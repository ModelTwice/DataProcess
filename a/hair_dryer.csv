47889049,R26G0VCUDICIEW,108191918,5,3,4,N,Great dryer!,"Very nice hair dryer. It's a little heavier than my old hair dryer but it has more features that I really like. I have very short hair that dries quickly and haven't noticed any difference in drying time. I really like that it truly has several drying options. The heat and the blower volume are truly separate so you can use cool, warm or hot heat with low or high blower volumes. And I love the cool temperature option! My head sweats a lot and it's wonderful to be able to blast my head with a cool high volume blast of air. It's really cool, not cold, but not warm either.",9/21/2014
51859664,R2F3FPEN76Y8A,108191918,5,3,3,N,Great Hairdryer with Secure Attachments,"Great hairdryer for the price! It's not too loud, fairly lightweight, ergonomic, great colors, and my favorite part of all-- the attachments actually stay on. I had another Conair that I loved, except that the &#34;concentrator&#34; attachment would regularly fall off while I was drying my hair, and then it was burning hot, so I couldn't put it back on until after I was already finished drying. This one stays on and rotates securely.<br /><br />I can't pretend I notice a difference in my hair texture. It's always frizzy, especially in summer, and this didn't seem to cure that... but it works as well as my much more expensive hairdryers (I bought a professional one from a salon years ago) at a fraction of the price. The filter is also easy to clean and doesn't get gunked up easily.",8/18/2014
51978353,RL09IDNG4VVOM,108191918,4,1,1,N,Dries my hair fast!,"I have super thick hair and drying my hair is a chore to say the least. When my old Revlon dryer finally hit the crapper, I bought this at my local CVS. This dryer works like a charm and dries my hair lightning quick. The attachments works well and I love how you don't have to hold down a button to get cool air. I just wish it had a longer cord.<br /><br />Note: if you're thinking of getting this, buy it on here! CVS and the other drugstores overcharge; I paid almost $40 for this at CVS. That's the only thing I regret about the purchase, hehe!",4/19/2014
26994002,R4RYX1FXEG93P,108191918,4,0,0,N,Plain Old Hair Dryer,I purchased the 1875 Shine Styler hair dryer because my 17 year old Conair 1600 started to throw blue sparks when I changed the settings. I really like the controls on the 1875 because they are comfortable while gripping the hair dryer and they are easy to use. I held a lot of hair dryers in stores and found this one to be light weight and comfortable to hold. The price was right too. $19.99. I'm a guy who just needs a hair dyer to dry my hair every once in a while. My hair is only a few inches long. The 1875 Watt Thermal Shine Styler does the job.,11/10/2013
43536593,R1K3FA3JEBTDAL,108191918,5,16,17,N,Excellent dryer,"I love this hair dryer. I bought it as a replacement after my second Revlon dryer bit the dust. I use it on the Low/Warm setting and it's just perfect for my hair type (thin/damaged hair), not too hot, but not too cold. Dries my hair super fast too, literally under 5 minutes and done. My other 2 hair dryers hardly put out any heat on the medium settings and took forever to dry my hair. Very happy with this since again, my hair is already damaged from heat.<br />I really love the comb attachment it came with too. I've never seen anything like this before. After your hair is dry/almost dry, if you put the dryer on the low/hot with the attachment on, it really helps with straightening your hair and pretty much eliminates the need for a flat iron, another huge plus. It comes with a concentrator attachment too, but I don't use that.<br />The dryer is very lightweight, quiet,  the cord is short so you're not tripping all over it, but there's still enough length to work with without pulling it out of the wall.<br />This is a great little hair dryer over all for a small price.",3/11/2013

I purchased it three times because I loved it so much. However, each hairdryer lasted less than a year, and I used it probably four times per week. I was very disappointed in what seemed to be a great hairdryer of poor quality in that was unable to last. Sad to have to switch to something more reliable!",7/10/2012
27684485,R2J14KCWYKE0BM,108191918,4,4,5,N,A very good hair dryer,"I bought this hair dryer after some research. It is extremely light, not very noisy, and the buttons are in the right place. The cord is a little short (about 62 inches) but for a tiny New York bathroom with an electrical outlet at a waist level it is actually perfect. However, I can see how it can be trouble if your electrical outlets are low.<br /><br />I can't tell if the ionic feature does what is supposed to do because I had not owned a hair dryer before this one for a long time so I can't compare. I have very thick just-below-the-shoulders hair and it takes me about 5 minutes to dry it. It still gets static in winter.<br /><br />I like the simple white and black color. To me it looks much better than the silver finish on higher-end driers because they still look like plastic and fake and this one is not pretending to be what it is not. The painted text to identify on/off and temperature settings wore off in two days but the settings are intuitive and so you don't really need the text once you saw what is where. I've had it for just under a year and it is working just fine. All in all great purchase.",6/10/2012
24850466,RB5DVPRGQIHDY,108191918,5,1,2,N,Like a hotel blowdryer!,"I grew up using a crappy blowdryer that my mom originally bought for our cat. I have straight hair so I never really blowdry except when I need to tie my hair up in a neat bun (for work). I bought this on sale for $10 at Target and it exceeded my expectations! It's really powerful and exactly like the ones in 5-star hotels. I love that it has cold, warm and hot settings. It came with that round attachment which I've never used. The little booklet in the box shows a hair straightening attachment which was not included in mine. I don't really need it so it's not a big deal. I highly recommend this product. It is a little big but not heavy.",3/22/2012

42782684,R2XJ0XUR2BXMXD,108191918,5,71,72,N,Perfect!,"I was skeptical about the ceramic disk/ion feature, that it would actually reduce the static electricity, fly-aways & frizzies and make my hair shinier and more manageable.  How could a thing that blows air do all that?   I knew I needed to look for something new though because after using my old blow dryer, my medium thick, wavy, frizzy fly-away hair was not presenting itself in a pretty way but just looking worse and worse.  Any grade of shampoo and conditioner didn't seem to make a big difference overall.    It got to be where I just dreaded the task of doing my hair.    After using this Conair dryer one time, my crown of glory was good enough to go as-is if I didn't have time to use the flat iron.  This is a 100% improvement over my old-no-special-features blow dryer which has been retired to probably dry pets and mittens and boots or whatever.  Now after using this Conair almost daily for about a month, I wish I had learned about the technology way sooner and saved myself a lot of angst over how to tame my hair.   I love this blow dryer and that it came with three attachments (I don't know which I like best), that it is light weight, has a sufficient length cord, dries my hair quickly, isn't overly loud, and most of all that I can SEE that my hair is in better condition.",9/5/2007

26256946,R2G5YGNQQHXDHS,109106777,1,1,2,N,Buyer Beware,"I received my product with great tracking from Amazon. I felt confident when ordering the brand name because I figured they had years of experience with these products. I purchased this item new in the box and I have had wall mount dryers before and are an easy install.  Conair's metal wall mount holes in the plate were too small for the screws given. There was no way to screw them into the plate to attach to the wall.  I had to search my garage for self tapping metal screws to match the hole size and finally after a good hour or so was able to attach the wall plate that holds the dryer. Once I unpacked the dryer and hung it on the wall plate, I noticed the dust cover on the back of the dryer looked loose. After inspecting the problem, I found that one of the prongs that hold it to the dryer was missing. To add to all the existing problems the grip that hold the hair dryer handle was so loos that it hardly held the hair dryer in place when it is sitting back in the cradle.<br />I called Conair customer service to see what they could do for me and I was told they have no parts for this hair dryer. I would need to contact Amazon to return or replace.  What a complete waste of time not to mention I threw my old hair dryer out. I will not be purchasing another Conair wall mount dryer in the future.",6/30/2014

That's roughly $6/year which allows me to justify replacing the unit with the same model.   That and the fact that the mount is already on the wall.

28857145,R1DIJWZMBR2MER,109106777,1,3,6,N,Burned out within months,"I was excited to get this hairdryer as we have no space in our tiny bathroom to store a bigger hairdryer.  I've used wall-mounted hairdryers in hotels and thought that it would be the solution for me.    Wrong!  While it's great to have it up on the wall and out of the way, the small size makes it better suited to short hair.  With longer hair you have to be careful to hold the dryer farther away from your head so that hair doesn't get sucked into the back of it.  I believe this is what caused my hairdryer to start overheating after just two months of use.  The fan became very sluggish and the coils would overheat, then it would spark and the thermostat would reset.  The fan would speed up within a few minutes to where it could keep the coils from overheating, but eventually this took even longer.  I took it apart to clean it but it is made in such a way that you can't get at the hair that is wrapped around the fan stem.  I could see that it was only a few strands anyway, but even this was too much.    Even when it was new it didn't blow a lot of air, though it did get fairly hot.  I'm off to buy a full size hairdryer with more power and will just have to figure out a place to hang it.  Blah.      p.s.  The nightlight is really, really bright.  I disabled mine after a couple of nights of trying to ignore the green glow emanating from the bathroom.",1/17/2009

Great convenience.,"Being able to have a blow dryer at hand, rather than stuffed in some drawer or cabinet, makes the morning routine so much easier.

I purchased another one and the plastic tabs that hold the dryer on the base broke. Customer service was horrible!!! They practically accused me of breaking it myself. The representative said that she owned one and my problem never happened to her. Anyway, after calling back I spoke with another woman who said to mail the dryer at my expense($9.00) and they would send me another dryer. Well I received the dryer yesterday, plugged it in and the plug popped and blew the circuit in the bathroom. I am almost certain they sent a refurbished piece of junk!!! Buyer beware!",1/10/2009

It's 1600 watts supplied ample drying power, and the unit even has the ability to be shut off from the handset... a feature I am very fond of!  The problem; they don't last!  My first one lasted about 9 months and then began to continually overheat and shut off several times during my styling process.  Blowing into the back got old pretty quick, and in the hope that I just got that one lemon, I decided to order another.  I've owed my present unit for not quite a year now, and a few days ago I went to turn it on, and it just wouldn't.  Terminal.  I find myself again in need of a new wall mounted hair dryer, dreading removing this one and remounting the next.

My children are biracial so I have to find products that can accompany their individual hair textures. My daughter has coarse thick hair whereas my son has thin straight hair.

It isn't very heavy which adds to its ease of use.<br /><br />Out of the three attachments, I use the &#34;big comb&#34; right after washing my hair and the &#34;small comb&#34; for touch ups. I would say without a good thermal balm, heat protectant, etc... It make be a little freezy. Since my hair is so curly, I am uses to using such products so if you dont, you may want to.<br /><br />The heat dial only has 3 ranges which I thought would be an issue. I would say medium is good for most people. I have never had a problem with not getting the right temperature for my needs.<br /><br />Overall, I am happy with my purchase.

And depending on what product you have in my your hair the whole dryer might slide from your hand.

It dryed my hair SO fast. I always put in Renewing Argon Oil of Morocco extra penetrating treatment from Organix (about 5 dollars at Walmart) before I blow dry my hair which leaves it smooth and soft, so I'm not sure how the dryer would have done on it's own without it, but I am still blown away with how fast, efficient, and quiet this dryer is. Seriously such a great find.<br /><br />My ONLY complaint is that it is kind of bigger and while it's light when you're just holding it, it can make your wrist tired pretty fast if you have a lot of hair to dry.

I can tell you definitively that it has 3 heat settings, but only 2 fan settings.  The only difference between the medium and high settings is the temperature that blows out.  The fan speeds are actually low and medium.  It turns out that this worked out fine for me, because I wanted a dryer that didn’t feel like a hurricane while trying to style my short hair.<br /><br />People with long, thick hair probably won’t like this dryer because it doesn’t have a real powerful fan speed.  May I recommend for you guys the Conair 1875 Watt Ion Shine Hair Styler.  That dryer has 2 fan speeds, one is a gentle breeze, the other a virtual hurricane, but I bet it dries long hair in a jiffy.

The other two have barely any room between the bristles, and so unless you have extremely short hair, you are not going to be able to run it through your hair. So you are left with the Boars hair brush. But that too, is pretty much useless, because the bristles are really long, and really weak, they don't get into your hair at all, rather they just skim over the top of it.

I didn't even finish drying my hair with it, my Conair takes me 5 minutes tops to dry my thick, shoulder length hair. I was on 20 minutes with this one and I had had enough. Also, it kept sucking my hair into the vents which was rather painful. This hair dryer is severely lacking oomph.

I'm not so good about consistently using them because I'm lazy. Well, I also know how harsh blow-drying can be on hair (particularly colored like mine), so I tend to avoid it. But every so often (more so in the winter), I find I need to dry my hair quickly instead of waiting. My last hair dryer died in a blaze of glory - well, actually it more or less fizzled and refused to turn on. So when this popped up in my Vine selection, I selected it.<br /><br />This Remington hair dryer comes with attachments - one, a diffuser, that looks like an alien product (apparently used for curly hair), and a funnel appendage that reminds me of an airplane wind tunnel. I don't have curly hair so I didn't bother with the diffuser (I really wish it had not been included because all it does it take up valuable drawer space), but I did test out the Wind Tunnel (much as I like pretending it's a wind tunnel for miniature airplanes, I would like to know, what is this thing called really?).<br /><br />I love all the settings! My last hair dryer pretty much had hi-lo, hot-cold and that was it. This has 3 heat settings and 2 speeds along with a cold blast setting, allowing for a more controlled drying experience. I found it really dried my thick, wavy hair well (another reason why I hate drying my hair - it usually takes 30 minutes for it to be all dry) and relatively quickly. The Wind Tunnel also helped to ensure nice, smooth, straight hair - the way I like to style my hair.<br /><br />Overall, I'm impressed and pleased. I wish that the diffuser hadn't been included because I have no need for it and the space it takes up BUT I know that those with curly hair may appreciate it.<br /><br />UPDATE 09/18/16: While I still like this product, I have since received a Bio Ionic from Vine, which I like more. The Remington's Cool Burst is far too easily activated when I am drying my hair, a problem I don't have with the Bio Ionic. Therefore, I am taking away 1-star to show this.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*y: *C.S. Light*",8/25/2015

It also says that its ceramic technology prevents hair damage and dries hair faster.<br /><br />Since using the Remington hair dryers (daily) my hair (untreated and treated) do not show hair damage at all - no split ends, no dry/brittle, no fly-away. Whether this is attributable to the dryer or my hair product (changed when I started treating my hair), I cannot say. I use shampoo & conditioners about every other day and dry my hair every day.<br /><br />Dry time is fast. The new model doesn't seem to have a faster dry, but the dry time is pretty quick nonetheless. I do not use either attachment. This dryer comes with a diffuser (Remington caught flak with the last model not including a diffuser) and a directional blower.

However, in real world day-to-day use it is very capable and effective at drying and styling.<br /><br />It feels solid and well built without being too hefty.  It has very solid cord connectors and circuit breaker protection built into the plug...excellent safety features!  The handle and controls are very well placed for ease of use.  They stay cool to the touch during use.  It has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings.  Low speed and low heat works best for us. It puts out a huge amount of hot air at high heat and high speed.  It has a cool air blow feature which is good for finishing the drying process.  It has a couple of attachments, a concentrator and diffuser, which you may find useful.  It definitely is not portable though it is transportable if weight is not an issue.<br /><br />Hair dryers are a commodity and there are a lot of choices.

48428870,R2M2LJ7GISCJZ4,127431946,5,0,0,Y,Great working hair dryer at an economical price,"This is a great hair dryer at a fantastic price.  It contains all the elements I have in my older and much more expensive hair dryer.  It uses ionic ceramic toumaline to help reduce frizz and static that occurs from blow drying your hair.  It has three heat settings and two blower speeds.  I generally use the medium heat and the high blower, but I like to have the option to do a quicker dry with high heat when needed.  It also includes the cool shot button which allows you to quickly cool the dryer down in the midst of drying and styling.<br /><br />It has an easily removable filter, which is a huge plus.  I once ruined a dryer because I didn't realize I needed to clean the filter.  Now I periodically take the filter off and blow the &#34;wrong way&#34; through it to clear dust that accumulates through time.  I do this about one a week or so and it helps keep the dryer running well and from burning out.  I have placed a towel hook next to my bathroom sink and I hang the dryer on it.  It keeps it off the counter, saving room and keeping it within easy reach.<br /><br />The dryer comes with both a concentrator for when you are styling your hair or trying to focus the drying effort as well as a diffuser. The latter is important for me as my hair has a lot of wave and curl and blow drying it without the diffuser turns it all to frizz instead of curls.<br /><br />I'm very pleased with this dryer and recommend it as a good and fairly inexpensive choice.",8/15/2015

It has three heat and two speed settings, and a cool shot button to help set your style. It's 1875 watts- so it's nice and strong though not as powerful my professional hair dryer that does dry my hair faster. But my hair has been getting split ends and damaged, so I love that this dryer is designed to protect against heat damage. Only time will tell if that feature works, but I sure need it. This also has the usual attachments that I never use but they look the same as what typically comes with a blow dryer. My biggest problem with blow dryers is the motor dies from not regularly cleaning the lint filter (which draws in dust and causes the motor to overheat). So one great feature is this Remington has a removable filter for easy cleaning, and that will definitely prolong the life of the hair dryer if the filter is cleaned out regularly.<br /><br />My hair comes out smooth and nice with the Remington. My favorite part about the design is it's comfortable to hold, the controls are placed well for comfortable use and most of all it's super lightweight. Also, this dryer is not as loud as most others. It looks great in purple too. I do wish the cord was a little longer. It's long enough for plugging into a high outlet in a bathroom, but if I need to use a lower outlet in another room  then the cord is too short for me to stand and dry my hair (though adequate if I sit down). I'm used to a longer cord, so others may not mind the cord length, but I'm taking one star off as I think the cord should be at least a foot longer.

The shell of the DC and Revlon are plastic while the T|Studio uses better quality materials.

It's nothing special, but it's a nice touch that you can remove it vs. trying to get all the gunk out while wrangling the rest of the dryer.  We don't use the attachments for curly hair, so while they were included and seem durable, we'd not be able to say how well they work.

First, OMG..what /who are these people on here giving this hair dryer such rave reviews?  This dryer is NOT EVEN 1600 WATTS!!!!!!!!!!@!!!!!!!!!!!!!  How can anyone say best hair dryer ever. no need for the low setting as the high is perfect, blah blah.  I am convinced that I can no longer go by reviews on here. This dryer is in NO WAY 2000 watts.  I can hold the nozzle (with the nozzle on which is more extreme air flow) right to my skin and my sking doesnt even get close to warm.  How can this dryer be 20000 watts when it is barely blowing out any air to even directly make it to my round brush and it doesnt burn my skin at all directly up against my skin on the highest setting, which is supposed to be Hot?  This is in now way hot, no way 20000 watts, I dont even think this is 1600.  What are all you people thinking to write reveiws with a dryer that is no stronger than a conair at CVS?

I have the dryer.  It is not even 1600 watts and that is no lie.  Plus, I paid 200 for a dryer where the cold button i have to hold down???  The cheaper dryers, yes.

The first model I owned was the evolution model ($300 retail) and used it for 5 years.  I still have it and it works.  I replaced it with the feather weight model only because I had back surgery and the evolution was a little heavy to hold over the top of my head for any length of time, so I switched.      The feather weight is an excellent hairdryer - my hair is extremely thick and curly.  This dryer dries it from completely wet to dry, smooth and straight in 12 minutes and I have A LOT of hair.  I recommend using the attachment to concentrate the airflow exactly where you want it.  I only take the attachment off when I want to simply blow the water out of my hair before styling it - then I put the attachment back on.    Don't hesitate - especially if you have unruly, curly, thick hair that takes a long time to dry.  This one shortens the time, smooths the hair shaft, and straightens great.  I also use John Frieda products (especially the hairspray for curly hair) as well - the hairspray will keep your hair straight for one day - and that is a true fact!",4/23/2011

I now have sections of hair that have been burned off. Also, when I put my hair in a ponytail, I have hundreds of tiny short hairs sticking up because hairs were burned off. I also got 2 third degree burns on my skin.     I purchased the Featherweight first, took it back for the Evolution (thought maybe with more settings it would be ok). That's when I noticed my hair has been singed off. With the Featherweight, you have two heat choices, flame thrower or cold.     The hottest setting on the Evolution is the one that singed my hair off. The medium setting, isn't quite hot enough to get my hair straight. So, back this one is going too.     For what it's worth, my sister RAVED about this dryer and she bought the Evolution, AND the Featherweight, AND the travel one. She is made of money though and I think unless something is outrageously expensive, she gets it in her head it is worthless. Also, she always uses the diffuser and always does the curly look (probably on cool).     I will be sticking with the Elchim line, which I thought was outrageously expensive at $130 but now seems like a bargain. I'm going for the Da Vinci model by Elchim this time.

I used to turn the unit off to shut off the bright night light.  But the button is like screwed up - maybe its just mine but its not easy to use anyway.<br /><br />The night light is WAY too bright for one.  It's like having a small table lamp on, so way to much to be called a night light.<br /><br />Also, the mounting is different.  You install a plate first, then screw the unit onto the plate.  It was hard for me to do compared to the other Andis unit I got and then after a while it started to come loose.<br /><br />If I had to guess, Andis purchased this product from some other company and slapped their name on it.

I have always bought the cheap hair dryers at my local chain stores.  I had no idea what a difference a high quality hair dryer would make on my hair.  I have long hair (about to the middle my shoulder blades) and whenever I have to dry it I have to follow up with a straightening iron.  I am pleased to report that with the T3 Featherweight I no longer have to use my straightening iron.  My hair is straight, silky, and smooth to the touch...I was actually shocked the first time I dried my hair.  Not only did it look great but it took less time than normal (about 5 minutes less).  I do love that this hair dryer is so lightweight and quite.    My one and only complaint is that the T3 Featherweight hair dryer works for about 1 1/2 years before it shorts out.  It has happened twice with two different featherweight dryers.  With the featherweight costing me $200 you would think that it would last longer! Unfortunately my replacement T3 Featherweight hair dryer died yesterday (and it's no longer under warranty), so I bought a different professional brand hoping it will last longer. Sorry T3, I had to move on!!!    ALSO TO NOTE...when I received my first T3 Featherweight hair dryer in 2006 & the replacement one in 2008, the company (Bespoke Labs) had a 4 year warranty on their featherweight hair dryers.

Sure it weighed about 10 pounds and didn't have a concentrator-nozzle, but it was built to endure. The Oster dryer fit into a stand and had an optional plastic hood that would go over your head to dry your curlerd hair. Those were the days!<br /><br />I have owned maybe 15-20 dryers so far. They last a year and then they go pop and die.....usually at the worst time imaginanble, but that's a complelety different story.<br /><br />About a year ago, I read a review in Allure Magazine about the Bespoke Labs Tourmaline Dryer. The T3 model Allure claimed, dried your hair 60% faster, didn't dry out the hair shaft and left your hair luminous and fabulous. Just like a movie star.<br /><br />Being in the market for another dryer, I decided to invest in the Allure recommendation.

Even if you use the dryer for a length of time, it doesn't get hotter.<br />-It is relatively quiet.<br />-There is a mesh screen that you can remove and clean so the inner workings don't get gunked up.<br />-It comes with a nozzle that is easy to rotate.<br />- There are no open ports that may suck in your hair. Gosh don't you hate getting your hair stuck in your dryer?<br />-The cord is a good, generous length, 114 for even the most out of the way electric outlets and there is a handy velcro strap for binding the cord into a neat package. Also thoughtful, a loop has been provided should you want to hang the dryer on the back of your bathroom door.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two settings. The high setting is way too hot to use! Unless you have asbestos hair.<br />-The handle is very short. The on/off rocker switch and cool shot switch are just where I want to keep my fingers. I am constantly accidently pressing the off button while I am moving the dryer. This is very irritating.

When I was all done, my hair felt nice, but nothing stuck out UNTIL I looked in the mirror!  It was nice and smooth (no flyaways) which I can usually only get this look when I use shine/smoothing serum on my hair.

52815791,R2409AP9NIOYOA,199558933,5,290,293,N,T3 Featherweight/Revlon Tourmaline Comparison,"I bought the T3 featherweight for my wife as a Christmas gift for my wife.  She has extremely thick hair and drying it takes a very long time.   After purchasing the T3 from an authorized dealer, I found the Good Housekeeping review that gave a favorable review of the Revlon Tourmaline Ionic. Since the Revlon is 1/10th the cost, I bought one at Target and gave both to my wife for Christmas.      I was hoping that she would find the Revlon comparable and we could save the expense of the T3.  No such luck.  She first used to T3 and found that it was much quieter than her current dryer and that it reduced the time it took to dry her hair by about 10 minutes.  When she next used the Revlon, she ended up burning her hair and refuses to ever use it again.  She's been using the T3 for about three weeks as remains very happy with it.     Being the more analytical one, I decided to do a scientific comparison between the two.  Note that I only had one sample of each dryer and I didn't use calibrated instruments, so these observations are only useful in comparing the two samples that I had.     The first and most important difference concerned the temperature of the air exiting these two dryers while set for high output and hot temperature.  The T3 held a fairly consistent temperature that most of the time fell between 190 and 210 degrees.  Extremes fell between 180 and 230 degrees, but these were for only a second or two before the temperature returned to 200+/-10 degrees.      The Revlon was much less consistent.  Its temperature continuously fluctuated between 130 and 235 degrees. Once I observed the temperature spike to almost 260 degrees.  I must have been one of these spikes the burned my wife's hair.  I took measurements over three different periods and noticed wide fluctuation during each one.  Keep in mind that I only had one sample of each dryer so these problems may be caused by a defective unit and not indicative of the entire line.      Both dryers are very quietcompared to those that my wife has used in the past.  The T3 ran at about 100 decibels at the intake and output ends and about 90 decibels on the side. From one foot away, the dryer ran from 78 to 84 decibels.   The Revlon was a little louder, running about 105db at the ends to 90db on the side.  From one foot, it in ranged from 82-89 decibels.  These measurements were taken in our bathroom which has almost no sound absorption.      The Revlon did push out more air.  On the high settings, the air exiting the Revlon had almost twice the force of that of the T3.   On the low setting, T3 had about 75% of the force of the Revlon.      Bottom line:  The Revlon had temperature problems and burned my wife's hair.  If that could be fixed, it would be a great dryer as it's 1/10 the cost on the T3.  But, right now, there's no way my wife is going to give up her T3.",1/13/2008

She paid $200 for the darn thing, so I would hope so!  In any case, I did not want to prevail upon her kindness again, so decided to handle this one myself.  I go to the web site - no info there - says to call them.  I call them.  They tell me to go to the website and send an email.  Huh?  Why couldn't they have just said that on the website?  I suspect because they have a LOT of defective units but don't want people to guess that, and if they had the warranty info there, well, it would be a negative and not a positive.  At any case, and at that kind of money, there should be better quality control (AND WARRANTY instructions!) so that I don't have to go thru this every 3 months!  What is wrong with this picture?  Yes, buy it if you want to deal with the warranty mess and inconvenience and cost.

I noticed that there were mixed postings however on whether the manufacturer will or will not honor the warranty. So, after hunting around on Amazon, I realized that there are two manufacturers selling the T3 on Amazon, with a significant price difference: Beauty Collection and Discount Jungle. Beauty Collection specifically states in its warranty description that it will honor the 48 month manufacturer. I plan to buy the dryer, but read the product description before you buy and decide whether the difference in price is worth buying with the warranty.",7/25/2008

When I first started using it, it worked great.  I was amazed at how quickly it dried my hair and how shiny it looked afterwards.  I have naturally curly hair and prefer it straight so I used this to dry it straight (along with a round brush) and it did the job amazingly well.<br /><br />Well I had this for a little over a year when all of a sudden one day it started shooting out some sparks.  I couldn't believe it.  I turned it on another day just to see if it even turned on and it did but you could see the coils in it started to get red and then shoot out some sparks.  This wasn't even overused or anything.  In fact since I was pregnant at the time I bought it, I had a hard time standing up for too long so I only used it once or twice a week.  After that little use it was already not working properly in just over a year.  In fact, for about 4 months out of that first year, I didn't even use it right after I had my son.  That was way too short of a time and too much money spent on an item that wasn't working properly.<br /><br />I am very diasspointed with this and will NEVER buy anything by this company ever again.<br /><br />If you need a good hairdryer, look elsewhere.

He bought me both the Featherweight hair dryer and the wet and dry narrow flat iron from t3. I love both of them! The hair dryer dries my hair in about 6 minutes (when it is wet from the shower)- I have asian hair so I can say that drying my hair isn't always a positive experience. However, if you dry your hair with the hot option first (doing the layers), then on the low option for the roots of your hair, and finishing with a blast of cool air all over, you will have shiny hair that is not poofy and is manageable.  <br />After using my t3 hair dryer, I don't know how I could not have it. Now, I want to get the overnight dryer. However, here is a warning. DO NOT EXPECT MIRACLES! If you have super frizzy hair or completely unmanageable hair, a hair dryer will not fix that. Perhaps you should invest in some better shampoo (I recommend Bumble and Bumble or Paul Mitchell) and perhaps a hair treatment at the salon.

So I called Remington & they told me this was the quietest dryer they make (they measure by decibels & this dryer had the lowest). So I bought it & it is super quiet, the motor doesn't really give off any noise the only sound you hear is the airflow. And the airflow on this dryer is super strong, its much stronger than my last dryer so it does dry your hair pretty quick. I am very pleased with this product. It comes with a 4 year warranty too. The hot setting is hot but its nice because it doesn't get hot enough wear it feels like its burning your scalp. I actually bought mine at walmart online for $27, it was such a great deal!

18087723,R2SD61ZO664TWD,236392593,3,0,0,Y,Good but not WOW,"I've been using this hair dryer for over 3 months now. I wanted to wait to give any reviews till I used this for awhile and I must say that it hasn't scored any points for length of use. I thought maybe if I continued to use it, my hair would improve from being dry, but it hasn't.<br /><br />This dryer has a low and high speed setting, and low, medium and hot heat settings. The low setting dryed my hair as fast as a cheaper dryer and the high speed setting is probably enough to even dry clothes rather quickly! It packs a punch! After using all three heat settings, I found that medium works best although hot doesn't get as hot as most other dryers I've tried and those tend to actually burn the hair. There's also a cool shot feature that works great if you're using the hot setting and want an instant cool down.<br /><br />The attachments are an Airflow diffuser and an Airflow concentrator. Both of these work well if you either want a wide spread airflow or a concentrated one. The concentrated one works good if you're using either a brush or curlers and want the air concentrated on that particular spot. The wide spread one is simply if you want a wider area of airflow, such as if you have really long hair.<br /><br />I thought that the tourmaline feature would make it somehow better for my hair, but I haven't noticed any improvement over other standard (and less expensive) hair dryers. This is my biggest dissapointment with this one and why I waited over 3 months to submit a review.<br /><br />On the plus side, the filter hasn't clogged yet or gotten any hair in it at all! This is amazing, since with other dryers I've used, it didn't take long at all before hair would start gathering in the filter. This one also has a removable filter, but as of yet I haven't needed to clean it.<br /><br />This is also heavier than most dryers, so if you have weak arms or otherwise have trouble holding something rather heavy for the length of time that it would take to dry your hair, this one probably isn't for you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it! It weighs under a pound, but compared to other dryers, it weighs about 1/3 more on average. This is also quieter than most dryers I've used. More time will tell on how durable it is, but the way this is constructed, I have no doubts that it will last a long time.<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars due to the good features it has, but for the cost of the money and the seemingly better for your hair impressions that it seems it should have, it didn't score there. It remains just above average.you. However, if you want to do something a little extra to help build muscle in your arms, this will do it!

I'm tell you all this because the keratin treatment is supposed to significantly reduce the drying time of your hair, and it does. So, while I did notice a shorter drying time with this dryer than with my other ones, it wasn't a really valid measure of how much better and faster it was, because any dryer is pretty fast for me now.    I decided to use the dryer on my daughter's long, thick, wavy hair. The unit got to be a bit heavy - it wasn't noticeable for my hair because it was such a short drying time (7 minutes?) but not as bad as many other full sized dryers that I've used. This one is a smaller unit, but it is loud. It did successfully dry my daughter's long hair in 1/3-1/2 the usual time. And, her hair was shinier and softer than with a regular dryer. I am assuming that's from the tourmaline and/or ceramic as we used the same conditioner's we've always used.    So, overall I'm pleased but I think the price tag is a bit much for a fairly heavy and loud dryer.",6/26/2009

49642495,R10RGBKRLKZ4JU,236392593,4,1,1,Y,Calms the frizz...,"I was very interested in trying this dryer; it features all the current blow dryer buzzwords - tourmaline, titanium and ceramic - all or severely guaranteed to calm the frizz for people with hair like mine.    My hair is thick, with a wave, and it absolutely mushrooms after blowdrying or in high humidity. It takes forever to dry my hair, so naturally your weary arms tick up the heat factor to get it DRY already, and that in turn ups the frizz factor.    I must say, I was impressed. The dryer features several heat and style settings, so to give an honest portrayal of the results, I kept the heat on the equivalent settings as my usual blow dryer. Then, after a while when my arms would usually get tired, I increased the volume setting.    Unfortunately, with this blow dryer, I wasn't faking the exhaustion in my arms. This isn't the heaviest blow dryer I've ever used, but it's up there! If there was such a thing as getting muscled from using blow dryers, I'd be Ahnold already. I wasn't faking it when I reached the point in the blow drying when my arms were saying, Enough already!    The dryer is more than enough power to accomplish the job. What was interesting was after my hair was dry, it really WAS less frizzy than the same routine done with my usual blower dryer.    The second time I tried it, it was raining out and about a billion percent humidity, the perfect laboratory for determining if all the tourmaline/titanium/ceramic add-ons actually worked to keep hair smooth.    It kind of did. What I can say was my hair frizzed, but it frizzed LESS, and it was much shinier than I've ever seen my hair in humid weather. I guess that's an endorsement, but not enough of one where one might forgo a flat iron to flatten out the kinks.     The dryer comes with a diffuser, which I've always found to be WAY too much work and time (if your arms hurt with regular blow drying, you'll be crippled when you're done using a diffuser on thick hair!)    If you're in the market for a blow dryer, and you have a problem with the frizzes, you might want to give the Remington serious consideration. It did a nice job for me, but the gold standard - not having to use a flat iron - remains elusive, even with this dryer.",5/14/2009
32228920,REH0I3CJMQH8N,236392593,5,1,1,Y,"My wife rates this as excellent, with only on CON--that there isn't one lower setting for the fan.","My wife (who doesn't speak / write English by the way, hense not writing this herself) especially likes the attachments and overall quality of this dryer, the three heat settings which provide just the right range, as well as the no heat / blow only setting.<br /><br />But she says the blower is far too strong and wonders why it doesn't provide a lower setting than hurricane strength.  I can only guess that this is because if the heat setting is on high there has to be a minimum amount of fan strength to keep the unit from catching fire.<br /><br />I imagine that a professional hair stylist has the advantage of being able to hold the dryer some distance away from a customer's head and that's why it's so hot and blows so strong, but of course someone using it on themselves doesn't have that advantage.<br /><br />Ceramic is nice, as well as the ion emissions.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Despite complaining about the strength of the fan, she already tossed her old dryer and uses this one because it is a professional level item.

I'm not sure I would love it if I needed to use a dryer on a daily basis but for the occasional quick dry user it is fine. Another possible issue if you don't have very long arms you may find the nozzle too long with the directional attachment in place.

32500930,RAC4N9LH5ZNKC,236392593,5,0,0,Y,Excellent Hair Dryer,"I am very happy with the Remington D-2012 hair dryer. The dryer has a nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap, but isn't overly cumbersome either. It dries my hair very well, and seems to keep frizz to a minimum thanks to it's lower heat and air settings. The dryer definitely makes noise on high, but it's not as loud as most I've encountered, so for me it's a non-issue. The attachments included seem to stay put for me, I've had no problems with them falling off or coming loose while using the dryer. The switches have a solid feel to them, are well placed too, reducing the chance of accidentally changing the settings.     One difference I've noticed compared to other dryers I've used is when changing the heat settings on this dryer, the fan motor doesn't speed up or slow down any at all. With other dryers if you turn the heat up the fan sounds like it slows some, and turn the heat down the fan sounds like it speeds up a little. Perhaps that is one of the advantages of having an AC fan motor instead of a DC motor that is wired into the heating elements via a rectifier circuit in the hair dryer, less stress and voltage spikes/sags to shorten the life of the fan motor.    The only issues I could think of is the cord is not as long as I'd like it to be. Another 2 or 3 feet of length in the power cord would make a huge difference for the better.     The low heat setting on the dryer seems to be cooler than the low heat setting on all the other dryers I've used i.e. it's barely warmer than ambient air temperature. Whether that's a plus or a minus should be left up to the individual user. For me, it works better this way, so it isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I felt it worth mentioning.",5/7/2009

I found the large attachment for spreading the heat over the entire head especially helpful for when I wanted to dry the hair without blowing it. Blow-drying also worked well, with ample heat to get the job done. The instant cool button would be helpful to a professional, but the heat-adjustment switch is sufficient for me, a casual user. The motor is pleasantly quiet.<br /><br />The only slight quibble I have with it is that the safety feature built into the power cord makes for an extra layer of on-off; and until I learned which button was on and which was emergency off I found myself fumbling around for half a minute before I could actually turn the dryer on.

The color is a lovely medium shade of pink that is in a matte tone versus a plastic looking shiny one.  The dryer comes with a diffuser which works well for my curly hair.  It has an unusual type of soft touch finish.  It doesn't feel slippery at all.  It fits well in the hand and the finish seems to be it fit a little more snug that others I have had before.<br /><br />The air filter is removable and be sure to clean it about once a week.  I destroyed a blow dryer by not cleaning the filter - it overheats the motor and kills it pretty quickly.  Along with the diffuser, there is a very narrow concentrator attachment which works really well if you need to put heat on a precise spot.  There are three heat settings and two speeds.  There is also a cool shot button for getting the air cool quickly as you are styling.<br /><br />The interesting thing about this blow dryer (apart from the finish) is that it is much quieter than others I have had.

This dryer just has too much power going to it at the low speed setting, which means I get lots of flyaways. If you always flat iron or curl after drying, or if you don't care about style and just want to get your hair dry fast, or (maybe) if you have really thick strands, this could be a great dryer. With my medium-fine hair, I just can't get that polished set that I'm looking for. My hair does feel nice after I dry it, and if I'm planning to curl or flat iron after drying then I really appreciate how fast I can get my hair dry. However, I don't like that I MUST flat iron or curl my hair to get it to look finished. If this dryer had a third, lower speed setting, or if the low speed setting had 30% less power, this would be a GREAT hairdryer. As it is, I break out my old Vidal Sassoon 1875 to finish the style (I got the Remington when my Vidal Sassoon stopped working on &#34;high&#34; and would only work on &#34;low&#34;).",2/10/2014

This dryer is also pretty quiet, it doesn't have that loud high pitched noise like most dryers do. It might be a little heavy to some people that are not used to Professional hair dryers but the weight doesn't bother me, it weighs the same as my old one.

I previously had a ConAir and in comparison I think this one is of higher quality.  It is heavier than my previous one, but I think this is due to the quality of the motor which I am hoping does in fact help this hair dryer to last longer than most.  It does feel slightly awkward due to the weight and length of the barrel, but nothing that I found as a hindrance.  I noticed that several other reviewers had trouble with getting their hair stuck in the rear vent, I have long hair and have yet to have this problem, but I do agree that a cap of some sort would be nice to prevent this.<br /><br />The hair dryer includes three different heat settings- I found one to be quite hot, one warm, and one cool.  It also included two speeds.  I have found that the fastest speed is best used with attachments otherwise my long hair would get quite tangled.  As far as time, it seems slightly faster, though not as noticeable as I thought it might.<br /><br />My hair does feel quite smooth and seems to be less heat damaged from my drying, though I think time will tell if this hair dryer is truly salon quality.",11/11/2013

I did not have that issue with this dryer. The one minor complaint I have is that the hot setting didn't feel as hot as I would have liked. The hot feels like more of a medium setting to me so it look a bit longer than I'm accustomed to to dry my hair. As far as the ceramic/ionic nature of the dryer, I'm not fully sure how this works with a blow dryer since it doesn't actually touch the hair like a flat iron or curling iron.

We have long, medium, and short hairstyles between us. We all have straight, fine hair and a lot of it. Our hair tends to get flat, not frizzy.<br /><br />The dryer does work faster than other dryers we've had, and it is quieter. Blowouts result in shinier, smoother hair than before. I like the multiple settings, although there is a learning curve, and I found myself pushing the wrong switches at first. The cold shot of air is a real help in styling, especially for short hair styles. We've used the concentrator, and it fits securely and stays on.<br /><br />I thought the dryer was a bit heavy, but my kids (12 and 14) never mentioned the weight. It's been hard to get them to blow dry their hair, but they wanted to use this dryer -- a big plus to me, I admit. (I'd be a stylist if I wanted to give someone a blowout, but I'm not and I don't.) It's a full-sized blow dryer and comes with loop so you can hang it if you wish. I wasn't sure where I wanted to store the dryer, so I temporarily rested in inside the strong box it comes in and tucked the box in my linen closet between a stack of towels and the wall. It's worked so well that I'm still using it, but it's a nice looking dryer, and I would display it if my bathroom were larger and had more wall space.",10/28/2013

Immediately got my hair stuck in the intake and had to turn it off and attempt to use it later.   Next time I tried it I made sure to read the directions thoroughly and use the mirror to get used to the air intake in the back.  My previous blow dryers have intakes on the sides. This in take is larger for more air flow but you have to get used to keeping it further away as it will suck in hair as well as air.  The cover does come off easily for the in take so you can clean it out.  I love that it's intended to last 4 years!  One thing I did notice is that you aren't supposed to store it in a damp area so I keep it in my bedroom and just take it into the bathroom as needed.  The intake has a wire mesh screen  that could possibly rust so I appreciate this extra advice.  It does seem to make your hair nice and silky.  Update: died and the customer service was impeccable!

12385709,RRGDTFUCQSZUC,253917972,4,0,1,Y,"Dries my hair quickly, but a little heavy","A few things to note about this hair dryer:<br /><br />TEMPERATURE: It has a total of four settings:<br />  1. Quick blast cold button (takes about 2-3 seconds to get cold when you push the button)<br />  2. Cold temperature setting (so the air blows cold without having to push the button)<br />  3. Medium/warm (this is the setting I always use and it is plenty warm enough to dry my hair very quickly)<br />  4. Ouch, my scalp is burning (I never use this setting because my hair is fine and it's way too hot for me)<br /><br />**One thing I really like about this hair dryer is that no matter what setting you're using, even if it's the hottest setting, the dryer itself does not get hot to the touch and remains cool.<br /><br />WEIGHT: It does feel a little heavier than I'm used to. I notice the weight of it when I pick it up and it feels heavy in my hand, but the ergonomic shape of the handle allows me to hold it right near the top so my arm doesn't really get tired. It weighs approximately 1-lb-11-oz , which isn't all that much but in comparison with an older dryer I had, it does feels like it weighs more. This is the only reason I took off a star.<br /><br />CORD: Long enough to allow me to easily dry my hair and move the dryer all over the place without running out of cord, but it doesn't get tangled or gnarly. It wraps up quick and clean.<br /><br />SPEEDS: It has two speed settings, high and low. I use it on medium temperature and high speed and my shoulder-length hair, which is also straight and fine, can go from soaking-wet-out-of-the-shower to dry in about 3 minutes.<br /><br />I couldn't really tell you if the ion action is working, because I don't have any way to really tell, but it gets my hair dry quickly with lots of volume and it feels fairly smooth when I'm done, even when I don't use a brush to blow it out. I recently went on a trip and left my dryer at home, which meant I used the tiny little hair dryer in the hotel. After a couple days of that I was VERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer. I am a mom of 4 and I don't have extra time to waste drying my hair, so the faster it can get done the better. This one definitely gets the job done.ERY excited to get home to my Remington hair dryer.

I don't think I would have come up with that on my own, so of course I then started researching hair dryers. There are about as many 'Top Ten Hair Dryer' lists as I think there are hair dryers! While there are a couple of (pricey) brands that tend to show up on most of those lists, I finally decided to look at it a different way ie: what 'technologies' exist and what would work best with my hair. I like a lot of volume and smoothness, so ionic, ceramic, tourmaline with infra red seemed to fit the bill - which is everything this dryer has. I read pretty much all of the reviews, watched the YouTube videos and even tho' people complained about the weight and button positions, I decided to give it a try. Well, I have to say that I am literally blown away! First, I understand why people complain about the button position as the first time I used it, I also kept changing speed and heat settings. However, it took me no time at all to figure out how to hold it so that doesn't happen. The heat levels are nice and consistent and the Cool Shot button works great - doesn't 'lock' but I don't care as I just shoot the roots before I finish each section so works fine for me. Regarding the weight, that was the only thing that I was a bit concerned about at first, since my old dryer was super light.  Now, after using it for the second time, I didn't even notice the weight, only the incredibly awesome results it produces! I actually feel like I have new hair as it is no longer dry and frizzy but instead is super smooth, soft and bouncy. I still can't believe changing hair dryers could make such a difference.

I guess I have very small hands so I can hold the dryer pretty well without messing with the buttons too badly, but so far EVERY blow dryer I've seen has the buttons on the side pannel like that, I think you just have to get used to it.<br />Overall, awesome dryer.

Unfortunately, the concentrator has a tendency to get hair stuck in the space in between the concentrator and the barrel of the dryer, then pull hair out.  While it does dry pretty quickly, there isn't a noticeable difference in how shiny or voluminous it makes hair look.  It's also pretty loud.<br /><br />The buttons could use re-working as well, and would be better as switches, rather than buttons.  The temperature and speed buttons are prone to being switched on accidentally.  On the plus side, the hinged filter makes it easy to clean and the cord is a generous length (~8 feet).<br /><br />Overall, the John Frieda JF1 isn't an overly impressive hair dryer and I wouldn't recommend it for the price.",5/8/2012

But when I used the curly hair attachment (the one with the prongs) it worked perfectly (albeit taking longer to dry).  My only complaint is that the buttons are placed right where my hand holds the dryer which means that until I got used to adjusting my grip, I would constantly be turning it off or changing the settings inadvertently.

48755970,R2J9HJB4DQUBS6,258419037,5,2,3,Y,Well done John Frieda!,"I got this dryer for my wife as she has fine, relatively delicate hair and every dryer she has ever used has made it dry and harder to manage (in the past I heard many complaints). Did this dryer fare any better? Well she hasn't had that problem with this dyer, and to me that's saying A LOT.<br /><br />John Frieda is a salon product label not an appliance manufacturer, but they seem to have chosen quite well the bathroom appliance to put their name on. It's well designed, attractive, and (most importantly) well-built and effective as what it's designed to be used for. As my wife is the hair-care expert I relied on her expert experience with this device for the bulk of the info for this review. But for the record, here's my two cents: Her hair looks less damaged, smoother and softer, has less split ends, and in general looks healthier with use of this device. The only downside I can see is that it IS a bit large. Now on to her opinions...<br />The number one thing my wife said she likes about the dryer is the ample number of heat and speed settings. These allow you to customize the dryer to your specific hair texture in order to dry your hair as quickly as possible, with the least damage done. It also has a cold shot button, a feature she would like better if it had a lock. It gets tiring trying to hold the button continually.<br /><br />She also likes that it comes with three attachments (a diffuser and two concentrators). These are made of sturdy plastic, and are very easy to snap on and off the nozzle. However, they do heat up very quickly during use so switching between them while blow drying can be a little uncomfortable. The device also has a nice long power cord which is convenient.<br />The only really `con' with this dryer would be its size. We have very limited storage space in my bathroom and this dryer takes up a lot of space. However, considering everything else this dryer has to offer it's not a deal breaker in the least. I would recommend this dryer to anyone looking for a fast and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair. It's an excellent value for a great price. Well done John Frieda!and effective dryer, that won't cause a lot of damage to your hair, (even with daily use). Especially recommended to people with fine or delicate hair.

She uses a hair drier frequently and have seen her with frizzy hair from it at times. I figured this would be a perfect test.<br /><br />The dryer has a balanced feel to it and isn't too heavy. The body is made of plastic that feels solid. If you squeeze it will creak and crack but it still feels solid. The intake and output screens are metal and should hold up well. It has a very nice cable stress relief on the dryer side that looks like it will help with and last through all the waving around that is sure to come. The plug side has a nice and compact GFI built into it so you are less likely to die from using it. Size wise I think this is a stay at home dryer. I would look for something a bit more compact for travel if you need one.<br /><br />The side of the handle contains two switches. One for temperature (cool, warm, and hot) one for speed (off, low, and high). There is a momentary switch on the handle in the trigger position for the cool shot function.<br /><br />After turning her loose with this for a few weeks my wife says her hair definitely is less frizzy and feels softer after using this dryer versus her other dryer. I can confirm this as well, it feels softer to me and I notice it is less frizzy.<br /><br />I'm sold on it after seeing what it does and as with anything your mileage may vary but it works well for my wife and she wouldn't hesitate to recommend this dryer to her friends.",9/13/2011

It is both powerful and hot and helps to take a few minutes out your morning routine. While it has many of the same features and attachments of other hair dryers it does offer salon style performance.<br /><br />Notes-<br /><br /> - Heats up very quickly<br /> - Long cord - probably 8-10 feet which allows you a little freedom from your outlet<br /> - 3 speeds and three heat settings<br /> - The back screen lifts up so that you can clean the dryer motor<br /> - It is a bit heavy, which is the reason for removing one star<br /> - Nice look to the dryer - it certainly does not look or feel cheap<br /> - Three attachments including a diffuser and two concentrators<br /> - 1875 watts (watch to make sure you do not trip your circuit breaker)<br /><br />Final Verdict - This is a well-built machine that will likely last you for many years.

Looks good and performs better.<br />The 1800+ watts drys your hair faster than the typical 1500 watt units most companies sell yet the motor is quieter than these other units.<br />The only point that some may consider a negative is that it isn't very portable. No retracting power cords, no folding handles. But it isn't meant to be portable. Most people use their dryers at home anyway and travelers will have to either accept its somewhat larger size because of its superior performance and lack of carrying case or look for a portable unit.<br /><br />This dryer has three speeds where most dryers only have two. It has three attachments, one is a diffuser (T3 charges an extra $20-30 JUST for their diffuser alone) to puff up your hair with its teeth that have air outlets at the end of each tooth and two different styles of concentrators to develop very high air speeds and concentrate the drying for quicker performance (works great for drying a spill spot on your clothing).<br /><br />It also has a cool button to blow cold air which is handy for spraying hair spray and then fixing your hair in that position. I find it also handy for blowing dust out of the fans and keyboard of my computer as well.<br /><br />Finally, it is not too heavy despite its thicker plastic construction. Some have criticized it as not having a metal body. It disagree, A metal body would be heavier and is also dangerous where electric and water are present, which is where many people use their hair dryers.<br /><br />So not only is a metal body more tiring to use for any amount of time but is hazardous to your heath if used in a bathroom. Pro dryers may be metal bodied but a beauty salon is not a bathroom and it is handled by a beautician, not yourself, so the dangers are minimized a great deal.<br /><br />If you want a pro performing dryer without paying the pro prices ($120-200) they cost, this is the dryer for you.",8/18/2011

It comes with the usual attachments, which I don't use so can't judge.<br /><br />It dried my short hair in about 15 seconds.  It dried my visiting sister's long curly hair in about half the time she says it usually takes her.  This is partly attributable to the 1875 watt motor, but I've had another 1875-watt dryer that was less powerful.<br /><br />The virtues come with two possible vices - this thing is heavy, and it doesn't have a retractable cord.  Only the first is a problem for me, as retractable cords add yet more weight and the storage area for them unbalances the dryer in use.<br /><br />Of course it is on the expensive side.  You can get a cheapo hairdryer for $15 or a good one for $30 - $35.  You'll have to decide whether the quality and the features are worth the extra cost.  This one will last longer than your $15 jobbie, and it really does a better faster job.

Well, most importantly, it's 1875 watts dries your hair very quickly. I have shoulder length, straight, fine but fairly thick hair and this drier has it dry within 5 minutes. I was a little skeptical about the ion thing at first, but I have to admit that my hair does feel a little smoother and softer after using this dryer. What I like most about the dryer is that it has two rocker switches with lots of setting possibilities. One controls the high/low/off settings and the other controls the hot/warm/cold. It's nice that you can do them in any combination which makes for a lot of choices. I usually am in a hurry and use the hot and high settings. (Some day I'll start getting up earlier or start getting ready before the last minute, but until then, I need a dryer like this!) It also has a cool button so when you're styling your hair and have a section of hair wrapped around your brush to make it flip up or under you can hit it with the hot air first, and then the cool to set it before unwrapping it. This works so well and so quickly, that it's one of the first hair dryers that I can get away with not using a curling iron and still have my hair styled the way I like it.<br /><br />This dryer is very spacey looking in a silver gray color with a purple/blue racing stripe down the side. The cord is gray. I guess what my hair dryer looks like isn't that big of a deal but why settle for a drab looking one when you can have one with a little pizzaz? It comes with a diffuser and two other attachments for directing the air flow. The size of this dryer is pretty substantial, but it isn't too heavy, it's just a nice weight. I would say it's about average as far as noise goes. I've actually had travel sized hair dryers that were noisier than this one. All in all it's an excellent dryer that does exactly what I want it to do which is to dry my hair quickly and leave it looking soft and full.",7/30/2011

By the time I get through drying my hair I am sweating due to the heat needed to accomplish this task and #2. My arms are really tired by the time I'm done.

All I felt was a cool breeze on my face while my hair took the brunt of the heat.<br />*Even though it looks really heavy (I kind of freaked out at it's size when I pulled it out of the box) it's actually quite light and balanced, so it doesn't put a lot of stress on your arm while you are styling your hair.<br /><br />Now... here are the features that I loved.<br /><br />*It has 3 different speeds & temps allowing you to mix and match according to your hair type.

But with the JF1, I had great results and a true cut down in the time I spent on my hair. And using the diffuser and on a medium setting, along with a heat protectant, I didn't feel as if I was frying my hair to death. At times, I have literally seen smoke arise from my hair using other blow dryers, even on a low setting.<br /><br />I highly recommend the JF1.

It's made with sturdy material and it isn't to heavy to handle when drying your hair. I only use the cold air since I don't want to damage my hair. It's nice that you can choose between cold air and warm air and each has a high and low setting. It also has two attachments which is perfect, depending on your preference. This a great product to use for your daily hair routine and it's even a good size for travel. It's a perfect gift to give any women in your life.

I love how compact it is (smaller than regular sized dryers), it is almost like a travel type of dryer. I find it very easy to use and that it gives me such the softest appearance with hair. I'm a College Student so I'm always on the go whether its going from class to class to traveling to yoga class/gym I definitely need something as flexible as I am. My hair is on the normal side, not too thick and not too thin. It is also fairly straight.<br /><br /> I feel that this hair dryer without the diffuser (black top) creates such a satin feel to the hair and that with the diffuser on my hair gets so shiny! So what I do is do about 2-5 min without the black top diffuser and 3 minutes with it on. The cool thing about this hair dryer is that it comes with 2 diffusers (one wide and one thin), it helps cater to your hair and what you want done to it. Overall this is an excellent hair dryer, everything form the Xtava line so far has been fantastic.

The Xtava Rimini 1500W Ionic Hair Dryer really surprised me. I mean, really. First, it is insanely lightweight (I think they say “ultra-lightweight”). There are 3 heat levels and 2 power levels and it comes with two attachments - a diffuser to help eliminate frizz and give more volume and a Concentrator Nozzle for focusing on just one area of your hair to dry that area more rapidly.<br /><br />Now, for how it performed - I have long, wavy, medium-thickness hair (and lots of it) that tends to get frizzy with heat products (so I limit them!) I generally spend 35-40 minutes to get this hair dried with a blow dryer. This, combined with the fact that I was in a bad car accident and it can get really painful when I am styling my hair for so long means I throw mousse in and let it air-dry wavy/curly more often than not. NOT ANYMORE. I LOVE this hair dryer.<br /><br />It took only 20 minutes to completely dry my hair with the diffuser. And, my hair looked FABULOUS. It made my hair so smooth and soft and with no frizz!!! I didn’t need to use extra smoothing lotions or serums like I usually do! The cool shot button helps to “set” the style and it also helps reduce frizz and boost shine (my old one didn’t have one of these!)<br /><br />I cannot recommend this enough! I wish Amazon wasn’t out of stock so I could purchase one for my sister. She’s always replacing hair dryers too!<br /><br />*I received this product in exchange for an unbiased, honest review.*",3/20/2015

I don't think it's horrible, but it's not spectacular, not like some of the other Xtava products I have used in the past. It doesn't look it, but it is lightweight and it's a really nice color blue. It comes with two attachments; a big customized diffuser and a concentrated nozzle for targeting styling. The diffuser was a little difficult to get on. It didn't fit as good as the concentrated nozzle. I also liked that it has a long cord which made it easier for me to move around when needed. This Rimini hair dryer comes with three heat levels, two power levels and a cool shot button to set your style. The different settings and attachments did make it easier when styling my hair. I could set them to what ever I needed them to be, when I needed them. I've never uses such a big diffuser like this before. It did dry my hair quickly, but I have very fine hair, so I don't need a lot of heat. It did help with the frizz and left my hair feeling smooth. I felt that it could have had a bit more power to it, but it was okay. For people with thicker hair, it might take a little longer to dry. Overall, this hair dryer was not bad, it does what a hair dryer is suppose to do and gets the job done. It's very easy to use and with all the different settings and attachments, it's convenient too.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post.

There are three heat settings on the heat switch, three speed settings on the speed switch, and a cool shot air button. On the heat switch you will find low, medium, and high temperatures. On the speed switch you will find off, gentle, and strong. The cool shot button is used to set your style. I like to use this dryer on him heat and strong speed. I use a round brush to style my hair, then the cool shot to set.<br /><br />The dryer comes with two attachments, a concentrated and a diffuser. The diffuser is great for those with curly hair who want to reduce frizz. The connector is great for people who have straight hair. It really helps me style my hair straighter, without needing a straightener.<br /><br />I really like how hight weight this dryer is. I have been having some weird back/shoulder problems over the last couple years, so the lightweight hair dryer is something that I can really appreciate.

I was able to hold the dryer by both the shaft and the handle depending on my needs to get the best angle for all my hair.<br /><br />2.  It took about 1/3 less time to dry my hair than with my other blow dryer even though that one has more watts.  I'm not sure if it was due to the less drying time of the fact that this is an ionic dryer that my hair was less frizzy.

If you have long hair (or a lot of it), that is something you will surely appreciate.  It also has a very powerful motor so that you can get the job done in no time at all.  If you are like me at all you need to get your hair dry as fast as possible in the morning so you can get on with your day.

It fits perfectly in my hand and it's just the right angle to dry my hair without twisting my hand. Another great thing about this hair is that it really does dry your faster. I am really amazed by how fast it dries your hair and does not leave you with a frizzy head. I can actually use the high speed and not make a mess of my hair. I love the 3 temperatures. Most hairdryers offer heat with the option of the cold button that you have to hold down. This hairdryer not only has the cold press button, but also high heat, low heat, and cool. So you don't have to hold down the cold button because the cool button is cold enough. I like to start out on high heat all over then I divide my hair and use low heat. After drying is complete, I like to set my hair with the cool option. The concentrator nozzle is just the right size. You can also remove the screen on the back of the hairdryer for easy cleaning.

I'm so impressed by the quality of Xtava and their products!<br /><br />**  Review Product Received",1/24/2015
12939676,R2PGRGFUCBQO6E,290876515,5,0,0,N,"Easy to handle, dries my hair quickly!","I haven't owned a blow dryer in over three years. I chopped off all my hair (I had about 1/2&#34; of hair left) to go chemical-free. Now, three years later, my hair is super thick and well past my shoulders again. I'm able to let my hair air-dry, but sometimes even after 24 hours, my hair isn't fully dry. I was excited to get this blow dryer to review on my blog. Sure, air-drying is less time-consuming and I'm able to do other things while my hair dries, but NOW I know what I was missing when I didn't need a hair dryer!<br /><br />If I have my hair styled and I get in the shower, I can guarantee my curled hair will be wet. A wet curl doesn't look good on anybody! With this blow dryer, I can quickly dry my all my hair or just a section because it comes with a concentrated air flow attachment. The buttons are self-explanatory. You have the cool blast button, the degree of heat button, and the force of air button. They are easy to press and easy to remember where they are when the blow dryer is up in the air against my hair.<br /><br />Since this is the first blow dryer I've owned and used since late 2011, I give it two thumbs up. It's a great blow dryer for the price you pay. It feels natural in my hands, and again, this is after not handling one in over three years. (Christmas 2015 will be my 4th year.)",1/15/2015
21680784,R4PKF9CTF7J2Q,290876515,5,6,7,N,Fabulous Dryer,"Xtava Blue Professional Hair Dryer is awesome. I have used it several times this week and I am super thrilled with it. The heat can be set to low, medium, or high depending on your preference. I really like that. Because when the weather is hot, I don't always want to feel a hot breeze in my face. I prefer it to be medium or else I start sweating. My former blow dryer only had the hot setting, so this is a great advantage for me. Also this hair dryer is great because it has a cool switch, a button you can press to get a quick shot of cool air occasionally. I love that it has a wind controlling cone that can be added to the dryer for styling! I like to use a round brush to make the ends of my hair curl under sometimes while blow drying......but I don't want my hair blowing every which way lol. So this is just perfect. I really truly love this hair dryer. So happy with it. Works very well. Runs great. Makes my hair look beautiful. Mission accomplished. So glad I got to try this in exchange for a review.",1/9/2015
23781368,R3O0522OXCFKVA,290876515,5,0,0,N,Amazing Dry Time with this Dryer!,"When I plugged in this dryer and used it the first time, I was absolutely amazed with how quickly it dried my hair, how well it straightened my naturally wavy hair, and how much shinier and healthier it made my hair look when I was done too!<br /><br />It took me about 4 minutes to dry my hair with my Xtava hair dryer, which is amazing for me! My hair is super long and super thick and usually takes 7 minutes at the fastest, especially when my hair is still pretty wet because I pretty much just got out of the shower. I was absolutely stunned by the drying time. In fact, it dried my hair faster than my much more expensive dryer I've been using for the last few years.<br /><br />I used it on the highest heat setting and and speed setting. You can dry it slower if you like, but I read somewhere awhile back that it's better to dry on a higher speed and higher temp, and get the heat off your hair as quickly as possible, so thats just how I've always dried my hair. Plus I'm usually in a big hurry so this works best for me.<br /><br />Once dried, I then blasted my hair with the cool setting, which worked really great and really made my hair less frizzy and gave it instant shine and made it look healthier too!<br /><br />While using this dryer the last week, I have also noticed my hair has been much less frizzier too, especially for this time of year! It's so cold and dry here, my hair usually goes POOF! As soon as I walk out the door, but my hair has been surprisingly tame this week, I think in thanks to my new Xtava Blowdryer!<br /><br />I also love that this hair dryer comes with a customized concentration nozzle so I can deliver lots of heat to one specific area. I didn't always dry my hair this way until recently, but I've found it really dries your hair so much faster!<br /><br />This hair dryer is also quite noticeably lightweight! I was surprised when I picked it up when I first opened the package. I love that you can hold it on your hair for several minutes and never get that tired, dead arm, from holding a heavy blowdryer!<br /><br />My only complaint about this dryer is I wish the cord was a little bit longer, but that's just because I move around the bathroom a lot doing stuff while drying my hair because I have ADD in the bathroom and can't sit still just doing my hair! Otherwise, it has perfect reach for standing in front of the mirror and bending over to blast underneath your hair!<br /><br />I'm completely obsessed with this blowdryer, especially since it will only cost you $29 on Amazon, and completely rivals the uber expensive hair dryers on the market! And actually in my opinion, it's better than my super expensive dryer, because it dries my hair in nearly HALF the time! Absolutely amazing!<br /><br />I highly recommend this dryer to everyone. Seriously ladies, stop wasting the big bucks on expensive hair dryers, this Xtava Rimini 1500W Iconic Hair Dryer will get the job done faster, and will leave your hair straighter, and feeling much healthier, and looking much shinier too!

I'm obsessed with any hair product so I was so excited to get this product in the mail. I couldn't wait to try it out! It is such a beautiful shade of blue. This hair dryer is 1500 watts which means it can dry your hair super quick. I have very thick and long hair. My hair comes down to my lower back. I was able to blow dry my hair with this dryer in about 15 minutes. That's a pretty good time for my hair. It typically takes 20 to 25 minutes to blow dry my hair. I like that this dryer has the cool shot button. I always use this button when I'm done to give my hair a cool down and to lock in my hairstyle. The dryer also comes with a button for 3 speeds and 3 heat settings. Another feature that comes in handy is the concentrator nozzle. Occasionally I like to &#34;blow out&#34; my hair and this attachment is a must to be able to achieve this style. Overall, I'm really pleased with this hair dryer and would recommend this hair dryer to any of my friends or family.",12/19/2014

I was using a lesser power one before, and wow, no comparison!<br />Dried my hair SO quickly, yet made it bouncy and beautiful.<br /><br />The amount of air blowing out was just perfect, and using the attachment enabled me to center in on certain portions of my hair and style using it.<br /><br />I love the bright blue color, it's made very sturdy, and the cord is very flexible while styling.<br /><br />LOVE.<br /><br />This product was provided for my unbiased opinion.",11/26/2014

I have long hair and constantly fight with the air intake valve on my other hair dryers as they suck up my hair and it gets tangled up inside!  The Rimini by XTAVA  has mesh like metal over the air intake valve and cannot suck my hair into it. Secondly, it is powerful which is probably why it says professional in the name and oh SO quiet compared to all the other hair dryers I have used.  Third, it is light and the handle makes it so easy to use and to reach the different control buttons while you are still drying.  Love that it has a cold shot button to help &#34;set&#34; my hair.  It comes with a control nozzle that fits very well and is easy to get off and on to precisely aim the air right where you want it.<br />All in all I will tell you this is the best hair dryer that I have ever owned and it is aesthetically pretty too!  I won't get into all the specs because you can read them above but it does have 3 heat settings and yes, I use them all during one drying and it has 2 speed settings plus the cold shot button.  It usually takes about 20 minutes to completely dry my hair and with this one it took about 12 minutes.  I did receive this to try in exchange for my honest review and I will honestly tell you that this hair dryer is awesome!",11/26/2014

It's still running great, and for the price, I think it's a great dryer. I have thick, coarse, wavy hair. During the time I've owned this dryer I've had hairstyles shorter than my ears and hairstyles all the way to my waist. The choices between hot, warm, cold, and high and low flow have made it versatile through all my haircuts. It's one of the fastest dryers I've used, and on high, the air has a strong, fast flow. On hot, it gets truly hot.  (But I've never had to worry about overheating.) The cold shot is cold.  My only dissatisfaction is with the claim that it's an ionic hairdryer. They must have put a tiny amount of ceramic or tourmaline into the unit to claim that it's ionic--it does not affect it's performance.  But other than that I've really appreciated it's reliability.

It's pretty much the only reason I won a hair dryer. I gets nice and hot, but not to hot to were I feel like I'm about to burn myself.<br /><br />I really love how the handle turns and folds up. It fits in my bathroom drawer perfectly.<br /><br />I'd reccamend this to anyone who just needs a simple blow dryer for simple things.

The best feature of this hair dryer is the Cool Shot feature, which blows cool air for just a moment.  This is nice if you are starting to overheat from all of the hot air.  And the best part is that it actually gets more powerful rather than less powerful when using the Cool Shot feature.  The only negative is that this hair dryer is a bit big and bulky, but this is not a major problem.  Overall, I like and recommend this hair dryer.",1/26/2012
52448173,RH90MB0KK48RX,303775294,5,0,0,Y,ergonomic basic hairdryer with a hard-working motor,"First of all, while Conair may want you to think that this Infinitpro hairdryer is travel-oriented by designing the handle to neatly fold and also including a tote, this hairdryer is actually quite bulky in size and not exactly lightweight. Having said that, there is nothing to dislike about it once you are settled on using it at home. At 1875 Watt, this packs enough power that matches most current hairdryers. It has two heat settings---high and low, and there is a button that turns off the heating element so that cool air continues to blow. The motor seems hard-working enough that I have never experienced any overheating issues. Now I understand that there is some claim about certain ceramic and ion technology that should give a smoother hair. Perhaps it's my hair, but in practice, I don't notice any difference from my existing hairdryer I bought several years back from a brand starting V-S.    Overall, I think this is a solid hairdryer that does the job just fine. However, don't expect any novelty.",9/13/2011

I would highly recommend it!!!<br /><br />Pros:<br />Doesn't die on me when I am using it (overheating). This is a big one for me. I have very long hair and it seems every blower would take a water break halfway through because it was being worked too much. Not this one!<br /><br />Nice, modern look. LOVE the spunky metallic green color, not gaudy at all!<br /><br />Small, lightweight size.  MUCH smaller than the older one I had, and not nearly as heavy. Your hand won't fall off after using it! :)<br /><br />Usable Attachment.  I wasn't aware when I bought this, but it has an attachment on the end to focus the heat for styling. Since I have hair that curves in and frames the face, this is PERFECT for getting that look!  I only have to go over it once in order for it to be perfect.<br /><br />Hot and Cold.  The cold is actually NOT hot. Yes, it's not hot! Amazing! LOL  And the hot doesn't burn your eyelashes off!

The foldable handle is perhaps the best invention since the invention of the blow dryer itself.  When folded it fits into its own carrier bag.  That bag fits easily in any suitcase or briefcase (or purse if you carry one).  The portability of this styler should not fool you as you have a full 1875 watts.

Has off, high, and low switch along with a cool shot that surpresses the heat for cool drying.  Works really well and heats nicely. I have short hair so it only took a minute to dry.  I had other family members with long hair give it a shot and all agreed it was top notch.    Really like the metallic apple color too, makes a boring hairdryer look like a pretty cool appliance.    The negative has to do with the weight. This is not what I would consider a travel hairdryer. One other reviewer mentions it weighs over 2 lbs and they thought that was light... I totally disagree. If you travel a lot you know that 2 lbs added to your suitcase can make a big difference. Even lugging this thing to the gym everyday would be a work out. It does come with a travel pouch and a nice feature of easily twisting and untwisting the handle does make it a little more compact, but it is still rather bulky to stick in a gym bag or carry on suitcase.    I highly recommend this unit for home use, for travel, I'd suggest you find a more compact/lightweight unit and skip this one.",4/1/2011

They also state that the dryer is using 'ionic technology' which 'promotes healthy, shining hair while fighting frizz'.<br /><br />One distinct feature is the 'folding handle'. You can twist it (careful or you can break it) in a way that turns the handle parallel with the body and therefore makes it easier to pack when traveling. It's also easier to store it in a drawer when not traveling.<br /><br />The 4 year warranty is quite good when compared with what you get for similarly priced electronics. First, it's 4 YEARS which is not bad. Second, even if you can't produce a receipt, they promise to honor the warranty based on the unit's manufacture date. You are going to pay for shipping to the service center and include $7 to have the unit shipped back. And, of course, they will not cover any damage that you may inflict.<br /><br />There are no 'negatives' I detected. The INFINITY iPRO gets you all the power you need, the noise level is on par to similar devices and the 4 year warranty indicates that the makers are confident that they are selling you a quality device and it appears to be so.

It does have a large-ish plug which I assume is a transformer from AC to DC.  I love the color which is more intense than in the picture - think Granny Smith Apple. I thought it would be smaller than it is since it is sort of billed as a travel dryer.  The handle does an easy twist to fold so it fits in the accompanying bag.  I don't mind the size as it is powerful enough to easily dry my longish and very thick hair and most travel dryers are pretty feeble. What more can I ask?

16313576,RKYWR6PV28BH3,328811288,5,0,0,N,"if not better, than a dryer that blows you through a ...","I've been using a John Freida 1875 watt dryer, which is heavy and tiring to use, because of my physical limitations.  I ran across this hair dryer, which I stored after buying the Freida.  The only reason I replaced it is because I was looking for a dryer with a cold shot.<br /><br />I used the dryer last night and it dries faster than the Freida 1825 watt dryer!  Since it's only 1200 watts, the dryer doesn't blow as hard.  It goes to reason that, since the air is not moving as fast, it will heat as well, if not better, than a dryer that blows you through a wall.  Since I have a lot of very fine, straight hair, which is shoulder blade length, it doesn't take much blowing air to tangle my hair.  Because of the decreased speed of the dryer, I had no problems with tangles, yet the time it took to blow my hair dry decreased by 1/3.<br /><br />My hair looked shiner last night than after using the Freida, which I attribute to the decreased wattage of the dryer. Also, the dryer is quieter than the Freida dryer.",12/12/2013

43636027,RLEM4KTS1YCED,328811288,2,7,7,N,Not for curly hair,"I got this for an overseas trip after searching through dozens and dozens of reviews of travel hairdryers **that come with diffusers** for my curly hair. I figured, why drop much $ on this if they all are mediocre?  And indeed I am glad I did not spend much on this one.  It does have strong airflow for such a tiny dryer, which is great for non-curly purposes.  But the diffuser does not slow down the air flow very much, and on top of that, the diffuser is SO TINY -- no more than 3 inches in diameter.  The low setting does not generate quite enough heat, but the high setting has too much air flow. I end up switching between low and high to build up some more heat, and only stick the diffuser into the roots of my hair so it doesn't totally blow out all the curls.<br /><br />So if you are picky about drying your curly hair with a diffuser, this probably isn't the travel dryer for you.  If you just want to give your curly hair a head start on air-drying because you will be somewhere cold, it's probably fine for that purpose.  Might be OK if you have very strong tight curls that don't get blown out as easily.  Or maybe you can get crafty and block some of the holes in the diffuser...<br /><br />The dryer did overheat a few times when using it on 220V with an adapter in Europe, but I think as long as you are conscious about not using it on high setting for too long, it should be OK.",9/23/2013

I do have to say that in some hotels and countries, I cannot use the high setting, I have to use the low setting otherwise the hairdryer will over heat.  I haven't had this problem in the US as much as I have in Europe.  It's really not that big of a deal because the low setting is still EXTREMELY powerful and drys my hair in a matter of minutes.

The cord is way too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewinds so quickly that the plug whips around and hits me painfully in the hand.

I used to blow dry my hair with an ionic hair dryer but Sedu's ionizer is DRASTICLY different. I use #2 setting (hot) first to get rid of excess moisture and then finish with #1 (warm) while using a boars bristle brush. I used to spend a long time drying, only to end up with large & frizzy hair, and then spend even more time using a flat iron and my hair never even came near the smoothness & utter silkiness that using the Sedu Revolution has afforded me. I have not once used my flat iron since the first use of this ionic dream of a hair dryer. My boyfriend literally was amazed as well when he saw me after less than 10 minutes of use - and he couldn't stop touching my hair!<br />I've never written a review like this but I hope if that you are on the fence due to the price - give it a try and you will not be disappointed.",1/21/2014

It seems very sturdy and yes, it has dried my hair in half the time of my previous ionic dryer.<br /><br />Note that the ionic setting emits less heat so if you need to style your hair you'll need to switch to the other position for more heat.<br /><br />I have round, straight hair, fine but thick and this dryer takes less than 5 minutes to fully dry vs. my other hair dryer I would dry for 5 minutes and walk out the door with wet hair.<br /><br />Also, worth noting that since my last haircut I hadn't been able to get it to look as good as when I walked out of the salon until I used this hair dryer! So now I'm convinced it's all about the hairdryer, forget everything else. Totally worth your money.<br /><br />If I hadn't already purchased this hairdryer I might have gone for the Solano since my hairdresser recommended that one (he also reminded me that the department store/box store dryers are not the same quality ionic dryers and you need at least 1875 watts...) but this one is nearly half the weight of the Solano and pretty darn great.",12/30/2012

I was hesitant to try the Sedu 4000i because of some negative reviews but I thought worst case scenario I can return it if I end up not liking it. Sedu 4000i is really small compared to other pro hair dryer. It look sturdy , has a sleek look and weighs 1.2 lbs, weighed not including the cord.

Medium thickness with some wave and I don't like to use flat iron or any kind of hair products on my hair. ( except shampoo and conditioner ). Sedu is also quieter than my old Conair and Solano 3500.

Had been using their Hot Tools dryers-- two at a time, one in each hand--quite a spectacle -- and then using a flat iron.  I was happy with the end result but wanted to reduce the time spent.<br /><br />Researched the dryers to death and then just got fatigued and popped for the Sedu as it has tourmaline and ionic, and it has a regular plug-- I had some bad luck with those huge GF plugs on my hair iron.  The price is insane but since I use this nearly every day . . . .<br /><br />Compared to the Hot Tools dryer, this does not get hotter (which is a good thing because the Hot Tools is plenty hot enough to fry your hair), but it does blow more forcefully.  The dryer is small and easy to handle.  Did not find it at all heavy.  Was able to use the one dryer in one hand and brush in the other.  It still got my hair dryer faster than using the two Hot Tool dryers.  And much straighter and much smoother.  That was the surprise, and the reason I say I am a skeptic no longer.  Something about the dryer-- the tourmaline? the ions? really does make a difference.  Because my hair was already straighter by the time it was dry (since I could use the brush) the time spent using the flat iron was significantly reduced.<br />I hope that with in addition to reducing the time I have also reduced the trauma to my hair.<br /><br />I cannot tell if this is worth the big premium over the Solia and the SuperSolano which both look to be very nice dryers.

After trying out at least 5 other dryers, I found this to be BY FAR the best for the money. It is relatively quiet for the airflow it produces- no hi-pitched whine like some other models. And it is VERY POWERFUL! It is heavier than others, but I don't mind getting a little extra muscle tone. It doesn't have a shiny plastic finish and can withstand being dropped many times on a tile bathroom floor-- trust me.<br /><br />I have long, fine hair that will get unruly and curly against my wishes unless dried a certain way.

33906849,RAIXK76IBCQR3,442401590,5,34,35,N,FINALLY!,"A dryer that meets all your styling needs.  It's not often that you can find one that is suited for both curly and straight styles.  The air diffusing attachment is perfect for creating soft, frizz free curls while the concentrator nozzle (more narrow and therefore a better conductor of air than most models with this feature) allows you to direct air exactly where you want it.  The dryer itself features two speed (low and high) and three heat settings (cool, warm and hot), as well as a cold shot button to lock in style.  For the highest heat setting, simply put the dryer on high speed and the hottest setting (careful, though...this is only recommended for hair that's UBER curly, like mine).  Additionally, the 9 foot long cord (complete with a loop that will allow you to hook it onto something in your bathroom or wherever else you store it) makes it really easy to use.  Another bonus: even on the highest setting, the dryer is considerably more quiet than other ones on the market that are similarly priced (you can easily hold a conversation while speaking in a normal tone of voice). <br /> <br />According to the information that's included with the product, the dryer is made with a combination pink tourmaline/ceramic technology that allows for a special emission of ions (these are important for eliminating static electricity).  I found that after use, my hair actually was a lot smoother even than when I used previous hair dryers with ionic technology; I used it to style my hair both in its naturally curly state and after setting it in rollers to blow dry it straight.  If your hair is really curly like mine, however, you might still want to use a flatiron to get that pin-straight look.  But for less curly hair or hair that's less prone to frizz, that probably won't be necessary. <br /> <br />Although this is by far my favorite hair dryer I've ever owned, I do agree with the previous comment on this product: it really would be the perfect dryer if it had a folding handle.

My favorite feature is that it doesn't produce a ton of noise like the T3 I previously had, and if you have a sleeping baby in the next room you'll really appreciate the low noise it makes. The performance is perfect and the temperature and fan speed are fully adjustable. I set mine on negative ion, which helps my hair look great before work and after the gym. My wife and I share it and she's as satisfied with the quality as I am.<br /><br />Price: For the price, you can't beat this dryer. I paid over $200 for a T3 and the Onei feels, looks, and sounds like a better product. The performance of both are good, but the Onei has more adjustment options, so I have to rate it higher.<br /><br />Shipping: I came back from a two-day business trip and it was waiting for me, even though I didn't expect it for a week or so. Of course the wife got to it first :)<br /><br />Customer Service: The seller sent me a nice email to make sure I was satisfied with the quality and shipping speed.

One of them broke after a short fall from my hand to the bathroom counter (seriously??), the second one always got too hot and stunk up my bathroom, even on the lowest hear setting (grrrr...)

21102295,RRYCPVX8E0TTC,47684938,5,1,1,N,Great Hair Dryer With Some Surprising Benefits,"I was able to get this directly from Amazon for $20.  I give it 5 stars because I think it is a great hair dryer overall for my purposes, and excellent also for the price.      I don't use this for travel but really like the retractable cord.  Actually I don't bother retracting it, but like the fact that I can keep just a relatively short but usable length of cord out all the time, which doesn't clutter up the counter.  With every other hair dryer I have ever had the cord was way too long and got in the way.  This hair dryer wouldn't be my first choice for travel, by the way, because it is a bit big and heavy as compared to other travel hair dryers.    At the maximum speed the airflow is probably less than most other dryers, but is sufficient for me.  Another potential negative for some people might be the larger than normal handle circumference, but you get used to it, and for me this size is actually perfect.    Another surprise regarding this hair dryer is that my hair is more shiny now, it must be the ceramic or ionic thing.  Being ceramic it is supposed to have more even heat, which is less likely to damage your hair.  Whatever is causing this effect, I like it, and was noticeable right away.    Lastly I am guessing this will last a while, given the 5 year warranty.  I previously was using another $20 hair dryer purchased at a local store, and they lasted an average of 6 months before breaking.  This one seems like it will last, and I won't have any issues with the cord retraction mechanism possibly wearing out since I never change the cord length.",6/5/2011

Now for the bad news:  the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time. Then, the folding handle, low and behold, broke in half one morning. (Of course, the warranty had long expired). This dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and I consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers. When I've replaced hair dryers in the past, it was been because they've simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out.  I'd caution anyone to consider this before buying because these 2 features alone, while very appealing, can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer's lifespan.

15059026,R39GA193GGU6R0,486774008,5,3,4,N,Great dryer with all the features I wanted for fine hair,"I've had this dryer for over 1 1/2 years now and I love it. My hairdresser convinced me to get a new dryer so I picked her brain for what features to look for. When my daughter said she wanted a new dryer I pulled out the list of features my hairdresser gave me and that made me think to share it here.   1) concentrator  That's the main thing my old one lacked and why it was worth buying a new one - just for that. I have shorter hair and use a curved brush to style in shape; the concentrator focuses the heat on the curve I'm styling and it does make a big difference. The dryer also comes with a diffuser but that's for completely different hair than I have.  2) power - my stylist gave me a number of Watts and I don't remember the number but this unit exceeds it. This is something to be careful of anyway. We had an electrician looking at a problem with blowing the bathroom circuit and he said it's common for new hairdryers to blow the circuits on old houses because new ones are so much more powerful. That turned out NOT to be our circuit problem but thought I'd mention that there are practical limits to high power that are a pain to cross. This dryer puts out all the heat my scalp can take.  3) cleanable vent- the back grille should be easy to open & clean out lint. Major impact on strength of the fan & on life span of the appliance if you keep the lint out.  4) 3 heat settings  5) 3 fan settings (this unit is actually a compromise with only two fan speeds + off but I always use high anyway 'cause  I'm impatient)  6) swivel cord vs. retractable cord - My hairdresser said she looks for a swivel cord but it was pretty well impossible to find in less expensive models even in beauty supply stores (realize pros pay over $100 for professional hairdryers) I looked high and low for this feature. It probably extended my search for a new hairdryer by almost a full year. I finally gave up on it when I set my sights on a retractable cord. The retractable feature also seems to keepthe cord tangle free. My curling iron has a swivel cord but it gets more tangled because it gets all scrunched up in the drawer. My biggest concern was that the retractable cord would give out but it's still going strong after 1 1/2 years. I love this feature as it keeps my dryer neatly tucked away in its drawer.   7) cold shot - My hairdresser didn't include this feature because she doesn't use it  but I wouldn't buy a dryer without it. This is a button that, when pushed in, makes the dryer switch to unheated air which sets a curl/curve much, much better. it takes a little more time to style the hair (which is why hairdressers often don't use it) but my style lasts days longer. Easy feature to find but it's not universal so if you want it you need to check for it and this dryer does have it. It's the blue button on the top of the handle.  Bottom line: I love this dryer. If it's been a while since you bought a new one, go for it. You'll be amazed at what a time saver it is. At this price from Amazon, it's a great value. In my area Target & Walmart sell this dryer for $5 more plus tax.  I'd buy it again in a heart beat.",1/1/2012

It did take a while to get used to the weight, it is heavy and the handle is at a strange angle that makes it harder to hold than previous hair dryers I've had.

I bought the Conair 223X Cord Reel Dryer in August 2010 at a large chain drugstore for about $35.  It worked fine and I had no complaints. I liked the sassy color and the retractable cord feature.  I have super thick hair that can frizz in humid weather.  I didn't see any improvement in frizz when using the dryer. I guess it dried my hair quickly, but I don't remember noticing that it dried it any faster than my pervious hair dryer.    Today I went to dry my hair and the dryer wouldn't work.  I pushed the reset button on the plug and it wouldn't reset. I pushed the reset button on my outlet and it was working.  I tested my outlet with other things and the outlet was working.  The tag on the plug said I should refer to the user manual.   I found it on Conair's website but it was not helpful (they actually had the wrong user manual uploaded to the hairdryer). So I called the number on the site, and a polite gentleman answered in less than one ring. I explained the problem, he asked me a few questions, and then looked up the warranty.  The item is under warranty for 3 years, so I am eligible for a new dryer. HOWEVER, I have to ship it to Conair's headquarters in Arizona, I have to enclose a note explaining the problem, along with the service # he generated for me, and then I have to enclose a check or money order for 3 dollars to cover shipping and handling of a new dryer to my home.     I'm really disappointed that after only 6 short months of very occasional use (i was only drying my hair maybe 4 times a MONTH) the dryer has stopped working.  I'm also disappointed that I have to go through a rigamarole to have the dryer replaced.  With today's technology, they could easily email me a voucher for a new dryer. They could also send me a prepaid shipping label and not charge me shipping and handling for a new dryer.      Maybe I just got a clunker, lots of folks like the dryer.

49313125,R3UK3F7HUIA018,486774008,3,114,130,Y,"Great features, but a couple issues","Out of the box, this dryer certainly comes with all of the essential requirements that I look for in a hair dryer.  I won't buy a dryer without high/med/low heat and high/low speed which this one has, because I do my hair both curly and straight.  I like that it comes with a concentrator and diffuser, because it is sometimes hard to fit aftermarket attachments.  The filter is easy to remove and clean It also isn't too heavy.  The color is cute, although I don't know if most men would like it.<br /><br />On using it, it has good power, and it's not too noisy.  It also doesn't get hot anywhere but on the very tip by the metal grate, and even that's not bad.  If you are a stylist who likes to hold the barrel of the dryer, this is totally doable.  And it's cool enough to put away immediately after use instead of leaving it to cool, which is especially nice.  The cord is a good length.<br /><br />The retractable cord is definitely a nice feature, but should be done two-handed, guiding the cord so it doesn't come up and hit your hand or arm (I tried it, OUCH!).  It's a tad tricky because the button is small and slightly awkward to get to one-handed.<br /><br />All that said, I have two issues with this product.  The first is minor... there is no loop or hook to hang the thing up!  I keep my dryer on a hook inside the door or my bathroom vanity cabinet, and it's an annoyance that I can't hang this there.  And because the cord is retractable, you can't really loop it around the barrel and hang it with that without negating that feature.<br /><br />The second issue is more significant.  I am no engineer, but in my lay opinion, this dryer has WAY too much vibration.  It gives my hand a bit of a workout while holding it.  I can't say whether this is a problem will this model, or just for some reason the one that I was sent.  But it is significant, and it is still happening after 10 or so uses.<br /><br />This dryer is nice, but without understanding specifically the benefits of ionic, tourmaline etc., I don't see anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.  Personally, I'd rather have one with a hanging loop.e anything that makes it better than any other dryer with those same essential features I mentioned at the beginning.

35143849,R29LG4LJS9AO9I,486774008,4,0,0,Y,Great color!,"Overall, I like this hairdryer a lot.  The thing that first drew me to this hairdryer?  The color.  It's a bright, shiny, fushia color.  The make is very sleek and stylish.  Infiniti, by Conair, is light and easy to handle, even when you're using a brush with your other hand!  The best part of this hairdryer is, by far, the retractable cord, which makes it very easy to store.  The filter is removable, making the life of your hairdryer longer!<br /><br />Your hairdryer comes with a concentrator to help straighten your wavy or curly hair and a diffuser to give it body and life.  It also is equipped with Tourmaline Ceramic technology which, according to the box, generates ions that work hair molecules to help dry them inside and out... Ions smooth the cuticle layer... creating a silky, shiny look.<br /><br />I found the Infiniti to be a very usable hairdryer.  With heat options 'hot', 'warm', and 'cool', and power levels 'high' and 'low', there are plenty of way to dry and style your hair.  'Hot' never got too hot and 'warm' was perfect for my use.  Some hairdryers take a long time to cool down afterwards, but I am happy to report that the Infiniti cooled off quite quickly.  The retractable cord is also very handy.  One quick word of warning about the cord, it retracts VERY fast.  Be careful of fingers or retract it little by little and not all at once.<br /><br />From my experience, my hair did look straighter and more silky than usual, which might be due to the 'Tourmaline Ceramic technology'.  As mentioned before, I really do like this hairdryer.",9/22/2009
50622061,R1ZES3JI1C5EHY,486774008,2,0,0,Y,Painfully Self Destructed After 3 years - An Update,"Updated 11/9/12: About 2 months ago the original plug went bad. It had a built in GFCI feature and the trip switch eventually became stuck so that it would not turn on. I replaced the plug with a new, heavy duty one I bought at Home Depot, figuring the bathroom outlet's GFCI feature would provide the same protection. Then last night, while drying my daughter's hair, it started to smell of something burning and a few hot ceramic embers came shooting out. One stung my daughter on the back of the neck and while I waved my hand in front I got one embedded in my hand. Very small but very hot stinging. I threw it away for safety reason. So, it worked fine for 3 years but died an painful death. Be aware.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I was using a 25 year old, 1200 watt hair dryer. It may lost some of its punch over the years but it did dry hair. This is an upgrade, but it isn't a radical difference. The upside is the retractable cord. This makes getting it out and putting it away much easier and faster. The downside is that the cord is fairly short (the big safety device at the plug end is another story). I'll learn to live with it, but when I'm trying to dry the hair of my 7 and 8 year olds, who move around a lot, a longer cord is welcome. Now I have to get them to move their head around instead of me moving the dryer around. One thing I have noticed is that my kids now complain the air is too hot, something they didn't do with the old dryer (I have to switch to medium heat, and then it takes longer). It has a hot, medium and cool setting (and a cool push button for interrupting a hot flow) and slow and fast speeds. The buttons for speed and temperature are similar and you need to remember which is which. The cord retraction button, which is not obvious, is up on the motor housing; somehow I keep forgetting it's there. Overall, a good dryer, with some benefits and drawbacks.",9/17/2009
42288687,RJQ15ZJHYN85D,486774008,4,0,0,Y,Worked well on fine hair.,"I used the Infiniti by Conair 223F blow dryer on my 10 year olds hair. She has a head full of long blond hair but it is fine. Usually when I use a blow dryer on her hair it gets to be fly away and static filled. This blow dryer worked great on her hair. It left it looking smooth and with a nice shine. She didn't get the fly away messy look from it. I started out using the hot setting and then moved down to the warm setting as her hair was drying. She liked that I was able to use the cooler setting especially when blowing it on her face to dry her bangs. I love that the cord retracts back into the handle for storing. Makes it much easier to put away when done using it and also makes it nice while using it that you don't have to have a long cord dangling in your way. I don't mind the color, it actually looks more of a reddish purple to me than pink. The dryer is a little bulky for smaller hands. My daughter thought it was a bit heavy for her smaller hands but I had no problem hanging on to it and using it. Overall, a nice blow dryer that works well.",9/11/2009

I am convinced there is no perfect hair dryer out there, but this particular one does a great job.<br /><br />I really like how quiet this is compared to some other models I've owned. Even on high, the noise is dramatically muted (if you shower during your childs naptime as I do, then this is HUGE!). While I initially thought the retractable cord would be a plus, it makes storing the entire unit very cumbersome. I keep my dryer in a drawer in my bathroom. My old dryer had to have the cord wrapped around it a million times, but overall, it was pretty compact. Not so with this model. The end of the plug cord is thicker, and difficult to bend, and the nose of the dryer is a bit longer then I'm used to. Not the end of the world though.<br /><br />I tried the diffuser one day, but found it to be a huge pain to work with, so I just set it aside...I've gone this long without ever using one, I'm sure I'll be fine without it. I always keep the concentrator on though (which only adds to the size of the dryer come storage time). It's great for quick, high temp drying, or for bangs. Overall, I'd recommend this. It's a good dryer that gets the job done, even though storing it can be kinda awkward..",9/7/2009

My 3 year old Conair dryer broke last week so I did my research and saw the great review on this product and they were right, it's great!    The dryer is a bit heavier than the old one, but after a few minutes you realize the heaviness relates to the quality. It almost gives it a little bit of leverage when you use it.     The airflow is salon quality. My hair dried faster, looked shinier and felt extremely soft. It doesn't feel over dried or brittle as it usually did with my old dryer. I dried my hair no more than once a week for that reason, but I can't wait to use it every time, if I keep getting these results.    The color is pretty cool and the retractable cord is a BIG plus, no more tangles and messy cords taking up my bathroom space (now if only they could do that with my curling iron ;)    Over all I highly recommend this dryer, you can;t beat the quality and the price.",6/17/2009

I was replacing one that had many of the same features as this one, except it felt like it was piercing my eardrums to use it. This one is much better, as was promised. In fact, it really is the best blow dryer I've ever had. The only reason I couldn't give it a 5 star rating is because of the button that retracts the cord. It was placed on the side of the dryer where it sticks out, so that when you put the dryer down in between blows, it pushes the button and startles me as it trys to retract. It should have been made so that the button recedes a bit so it isn't accidently pushed. But, all in all, it is great.

This is my third hair dryer with a cord reel, which I find convenient.  The first one was OK and worked well, but was noisy.  My second one ([[ASIN:B000BFJJ7E Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Cord Keeper Hair Dryer]]), which I used for only a couple months, was also noisy.  The cord in it was also too short (4 feet) and when retracting it, rewound so quickly that the plug would whip around and hit me painfully in the hand.  I had to be careful about how to hold it when retracting the cord.  It also had only fast/hot and slow/warm settings.  I got fed up with it, so I looked for new options at a local Target.  I found this dryer and was hesitant to pay twice as much for it as I did the previous ones.  I couldn't imagine what could be special enough about it to justify two and a half times the cost.  When I tried it, I was quite surprised.  The first thing I noticed is that it is heavier and feels very solid and well built.  I don't care about the weight--it takes me only a minute or two to dry my medium-length (for a man) hair.  The next surprise was that it is extremely quiet--even at high speed.  I no longer have to turn up my radio to hear the news while drying my hair.  It has independent controls for heat and speed.  I usually like to use high heat with the low speed so it doesn't blow my hair so much.  The 5-foot cord retracts slowly and safely and is just the perfect length for my situation.  I would not describe the quietness of the dryer as slightly better than the cheaper driers I have used before--it is a dramatic difference.  I have often wondered about the potential hearing loss my old dryers might cause, but didn't worry too much because it didn't take very long to dry my hair.  If I still had long hair, I would be seriously concerned about the noise from a cheap dryer.  As for how well my hair looks after using it, I notice no difference from the other dryers.  My hair if very fineand thick with some wave, so it is pretty easy to care for.  It will frizz in high humidity, but I live in Denver and humidity is not a problem here.  I have not tried this in a humid environment.  I highly recommend this dryer.  Update on 2010-10-17: This dryer is still working great and I still consider it the best dryer I've ever used.

It will blow air of varying heats at varying speeds, if that appeals to you.  I tend to just use hot and high.

It really does blast the heat, and air too, so drying is pretty quick.  The little detachable nozzle is nice too, as leaving it on focuses the air better, but I took it off once when I need to work some duckback oilskin treatment into my oilskin coat (no, really).

Here's what we found:<br /><br />My husband has very short hair and only uses a hairdryer on occasion.  He thought the Mangroomer felt good and solid in his hands-light weight and dries his hair no different than any other hair dryer.<br /><br />My son used the Mangroomer for a few days.  He has longer hair (about 3 inches long), just over the ears.  He traded off between a smaller, cheaper hairdryer to the Mangroomer and thought it was less noisy than the cheaper, older model he is used too.  He thought the dryer was sleek looking, more manly than the girl hairdryer he has been using.  The different speeds and temperature settings were a plus considering he's never had the choice.<br /><br />Lastly myself, I have shoulder length hair that has a course texture.  I use a hairdryer every day.  The Mangroomer looks and feels manly.  In comparison to my 1 year old Remington hairdryer, the main handle is wider and less fitted to the hand.  The buttons do not get in the way in comparison to other hairdryers that place them front and center.  The buttons on the Mangroomer are on the side, which never seem to get in the way.  The Ion button is located on the side of the barrel with a cool blue button indicator.  With or without the Ionic button I felt the dryer was the same.  A huge plus to this hairdryer is the speed in which it dries your hair.  It pushes a lot of air to dry quickly.  Another important thing to note is in comparison to my hairdryer the air does not get as hot, personally I think this is why the hair feels softer and more manageable than when I use the other hairdryer.  I actually noticed a difference in the softness of my hair.  It seems absurd to think a hairdryer can do this but as a person who dries her hair daily, I won't be going back to the other hairdryer, even if this one is built bigger for a man.",2/25/2012

I guess they felt this was an under-served market even though the total available market (tam) for men is probably much smaller than the women's market when considering that a) there are alot more bald men than women, b) alot of men barely comb there hair so they certainly don't blowdry it, and c) the wife's hairdryer is already sitting there if needed.  But, if you want a manly hairdryer then I guess this fits the bill.  It does have manly color - evokes feelings of a red Corvette.  It is substantial weight and feels good in the hands.  It appears to have extra horsepower to blow hair in a manly fashion and it has lots of speeds to fiddle with.  In my usage I actually found it to be a good hairdryer - it does the job blowing my short hair around any which way I chose.  But, since my wife has a hairdryer to be honest I don't quite have the bathroom real estate available to store two hairdryers.  Overall, I give it four stars.  A quality product but a bit high on the price/value when considering that there are other serviceable hairdryers that cost less.

Mine is still working,  but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  I've always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  This hair dryer is awesome.  I had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference,  but I didn't realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer.  Not only does it dry my hair faster,  but it leaves it looking much more healthy.  I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  I don't know all the &#34;how&#34; or &#34;why&#34; reasons,  but I do know that my hair didn't look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it.  I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  I don't use the high heat on this one because it's very hot and my fine hair wouldn't like that,  but I like knowing that the option is there if needed.  The air flow with this is massive.....really powerful... When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  but that's only when I'm just drying it to put in a ponytail.  Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  It's not a small dryer,  but it's not at all heavy ,  especially considering the power that it contains.<br />  They include a little card explaining that their products are made by women.

Nice color and the design is very sleek and sharp looking. Looks like it's worth a lot more than what it really cost. It comes in a nice box, so it's very suitable for gifting.The description says it's &#34;ultra lightweight&#34; but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer. I like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference. The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful. Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well. The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly. It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz. The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed. I also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter, it was easy to twist off for cleaning. Overall, it's powerful and does a nice job. I loved the look and it's easy to hold and use. Hoping it will last awhile.

It looks great and helps my morning routine go a lot faster. I am able to dry my hair quickly and I love the attachment that it comes with to be able to focus all the hot air on one section of hair at a time as I am brushing it out. When I use the attachment it makes my hair look a lot better as well than without using it. This is a powerful hair dryer it isn't the most powerful hair dryer I have ever seen but definitely a very good one. It is very powerful and dries my hair quickly which is awesome since I have really long hair. It is a nice sleek hair dryer so it fits nicely into my hair dryer holder and looks really nice as well.

12838137,R2TPCPT0RDOBTH,593915883,5,1,2,N,Sleek and powerful!,"This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer. It looks very nice! It’s powerful at 2200 watts. This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it's also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color. Other than that though, I really like this hair dryer. It's powerful and efficient at drying my hair. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.",3/1/2015
17305095,R27DV4303HN879,593915883,3,0,0,N,... thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong,"The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong. The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet. The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn’t bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles. Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use. I tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change. If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile I’ve owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change. The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all. The dryer isn’t completely soundless but it isn’t obnoxiously loud compared to others I’ve owned. I found that when I used this hair dryer my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual. In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn’t as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair and I'm not a professional at blow drying.  UPDATE: After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying. Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before. I haven't changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  I did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion.",3/1/2015

It comes in a nice box that is very suitable for gifting.  The pros on this dryer for me are that it is lightweight, has a long cord, is sleek and not bulky, and comes with a concentration too. The con for me (someone that has long, thin, fine hair) is that it tends to be hot even on the lower settings. Sometimes this is a pro but overall for my hair type it is a bit too hot for the total drying process so my hair tends to be more tangled at the end.

Because of the time it takes to blow dry, and the fact I am semi lazy, I have had the same motel type dryer for about 15 years (YIKES) and been hesitant to buy a new one figuring they would ALL take forever to dry the mop on my head. When I was offered the Xtava, Allure 2200W hair dryer to review for an unbiased opinion I was pretty excited!<br /><br />This hairdryer is a decent size, yet very lightweight. It has 2 heat settings as well as the option for a cool blast here and there. There is also a detachable piece to put on it for when you want to dry your hair section by section to straighten it.<br /><br />After trying this the first time, I now want to use it every time I wash my hair! It is super easy to handle, which is awesome if you're all over the place flipping your hair around like I do. One of my favorite parts was that the back vent didn't try to eat my hair! My old one would suck it in if you got it within an inch of that vent, I am tendered headed, IT HURT!  ALL of my hair was dry, no slightly damp spots at all within 20 minutes. I highly recommend this particular hair dryer for those with long thick like hair. Yes ladies and Gents, it IS possible to have lots of hair and not hog up the bathroom for hours on end!",2/26/2015

I cannot believe how fast it dried my hair.  Right out of the shower and it was only about 4 minutes for my thick hair to be completely dry and cooled.  This hair dryer is a little hefty compared to others but I think it is easier to handle than my other Xtava.  Also even though the hottest setting is quite hot the hair dryer itself only heats up at the end.  You can hold the barrel if you need to maneuver it.<br /><br />The power was unexpected.  My hair did tangle slightly but it was no big deal considering how much more volume I gained.  Even after brushing my hair it isn't flat.  My hair is smoother than usual as if I had flat ironed it.  The hot is hot and the cold is cold as if you had air conditioning for your head.  So, you don't have to spend extra time cooling after drying.  It was a matter of seconds after drying to having perfect cool hair.  The extra power of this dryer may have a learning curve.  I actually had to figure out where I had wet hair because I'm used to having still damp hair.  Anywhere I pointed it for a few seconds resulted in dry sections of hair.  That's how good this dryer is.",2/25/2015

It dries my long hair in no time and and it doesn't leave my hair frizzy. It is lightweigth and it looks nice. The chrome looking lint trap at the back can be twisted easily and pulled out for cleaning. It looks nice but be very careful because (correct me if I am wrong)  it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break. I am going to use and keep this hair dryer in the bedroom vanity just incase I drop it, it will fall on the carpet floor. The extra attachment that came with it is also nice. I also have a 1875w Conair infinity that I have been using for years. I love it but I compared the two today and they seem to blow about the same amount of air. If Allure is blowing harder, I cannot really tell. The small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is, I never use the cool air function anyway so it dont really matter for me. Over all, I will start using this Allure from now on and will give him hubby the Conair one. The other minor things does not hindrance the funtionality of this hair dryer so if you are planning to buy this, go ahead, give it a try. I think you will like it too.",2/17/2015

Being Dominican, I remember going to the salon every Saturday morning since I was 10 with my mother so that we could pay 20-30 dollars for our lady to blow dry my hair.<br /><br />Fast forward a few years (I'm 30 now): I work full time, am married, AND went back to school. So, I don't have time to go to the salon and sit there for hours until my hair gets blown out.<br /><br />Thankfully, with my hair, all I have to do are rollers and sit under the dryer for 40 minutes and boom...no salon, nice waves, better than blown out! Much cheaper than going to the salon, btw.<br /><br />I looove that the dryer has a timer, which means I don't have to watch the clock constantly. The dryer gets VERY hot, almost too hot (I used the highest setting), but that means I spent less time under the dryer. It's not very loud at all, which I also like. Also, in order to adjust height in most dryers, one needs to turn some sort of knob, right? Not with this one! I just push it down as low as I need or pull it up as high as I need, and I'm done. Some people may not be used to his, but it works for me.<br /><br />When I do rollers, I only use the Jumbo/Extra Large ones all around my head. Even so, I'm STILL able to fit under and inside  the bonnet.<br /><br />I took off one star b/c it was a bit challenging putting it together.

No worrying about accidentally turning it off or changing the setting, you don't have to hold the button for the cold shot, and if the regular setting isn't quick enough for you, there's even a turbo setting. This saves us so much time in the mornings! I'm thinking about buying a second one to have in the other bathroom so two of us can dry our hair at once. It did seem a bit big at first, but it didn't take long to get used to it.

It does seem to dry my hair faster than other dryers, especially at the higher airflow settings.<br /><br />It is noisy (increased noise with increased speed/turbo) and it has a tendency to trip my GFI and it once contributed to blowing the circuit breaker for the outlet.

In my house, we only use the hair dryer around 3 times a week total between my husband and myself (I only have to style my hair once every 4 days or so)... so this thing got minimal use.  When I bought it I was annoyed at how the temperature switch (to go from hot to cold) is in a spot on the handle where you usually grip the thing while you're drying.  I would constantly accidentally switch it to the cold setting.  And, I never felt like this got hot enough to style my thick, unruly hair.  My hair is crazy thick and I need a lot of heat to get the frizz out while I'm drying and styling... but I've had to deal with this and hair dryers not being hot enough my whole life, so this wasn't a huge surprise.  But then, a few days ago the heat function just completely broke.  So, now it only blows cool air no matter what.. which makes it basically useless to me.  I suppose that for $25 I got my use out of it for 4 months... but I hate that I'm having to send another plastic piece of trash to the landfill a lot sooner than expected.  :(",11/29/2012

Ionic technology because it helps reduce my frizzies.<br />2. At least 3 heat settings. Tired of warm and TOO HOT.<br />3. Power. My hair is thick and it takes some air velocity to dry it. Most dryers are pretty good, but the Turbo Setting does increase it. It's not wind tunnel awesome, but it's helpful.<br />This hair dryer met those requirements.

I actually bought this at Target because my other dryer had stopped working and I couldn't wait a few days for a new one to be shipped to me. I went with the intention on getting a different one but I got to hold them both in my hand and I really liked the way this one felt. The handle is sort of slanted back, which sounds awkward but it feels more balanced this way. It also doesn't have that annoying high pitched whining sound that accompanies most dryers. I also like that there is a cold shot switch that you don't have to hold in. It stays on cold shot until you switch it off. The sliding power switch isn't difficult to slide. The tension is just right in that you're not going to accidentally switch it off constantly during use, nor will you have a hard time getting it to move.

If it's quiet, it's a big bonus.<br /><br />My favorite is this: http://www.amazon.com/Sharper-Image-Ionic-Conditioning-SI745/dp/B00007M1U2/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_t , the Sharper Image ionic hair dryer. I like the travel version because it's light weight, yet delivers just as much power and air. Too bad this is no longer in production.<br /><br />I also enjoyed this: http://www.amazon.com/Healthy-Infusions-Wahl-Pro-Dryer/dp/B001E6G6FC/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top , and I use it as my alternative hair dryer when I can't access my Sharper Image dryer. This one, too, delivers great air flow at an appropriate temperature and dries my hair quickly and gently.<br /><br />Now, to our product at hand... it's heavy compares to the two I had just mentioned. It's not any more quiet. I don't generally use the air diffuser on my Wahl, but I do use it on my Sharper Image. I tried using the diffuser with this Remington, but whether I use it or not, my hair gets very tangled afterward, which isn't a problem with neither of the two I had mentioned. It also does not dry quickly as the title implies, nor does it make my hair feel anymore healthy than before I use it. In fact, rather than taking half the time to dry my hair, I think it doubles the time.<br /><br />My hair is past the middle of my back, so it's a bit long. Maybe this is a great dryer for shorter hair? I don't know. I can't recommend this to others.

She like many other children is picky about who dries her hair, and how her hair is dried.  She is blessed with hair that when blow-dried looks beautiful, but unfortunately the process requires working through the many knots she routinely achieves in her hair.  I've found that this hair dryer dries her hair faster than hair dryers that I have used previously.  Its a great hair dryer, its dual action fans give out more air, thus drying hair faster than ever before.  This has been a great addition to my routine because it helps accomplish the task a lot quicker than with other hair dryers.  The hair dryer has several settings, and when on the high setting I can dry hair in less than 5 minutes, which is fantastic for me.  I've been pleasantly surprised by this hairdryer.",12/15/2011

This hair dryer worked great on both accounts!<br /><br />The turbo fan was excellent. It definitely dries your hair faster. I have fairly thick hair and it usually takes me several minutes to get my hair from wet (from the shower) to dry. The Remington D3710 cut my drying time in half. I also liked the turbo button that clicked into place so you don't have to hold it down the whole time.<br /><br />The settings are easy to figure: 3 heat and 2 speed settings with turbo. The dryer does not run hot at all. I usually like a hotter drying hair dryer because it seems to set my style easier. However, with the turbo speed, I didn't have any problems. In fact, I prefer it because it gives me more volume and doesn't leave heat damage.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the dryer is quite heavy and a little bulky (to accommodate the bigger fan).

But quick drying tends to make big bushy hair, so be careful.  Most of the time I have it on the lower or standard setting.  It works great.<br /><br />It's light, well balanced, and a pretty color!  I use it mainly for drying my dog's hair (since I have none!), but my gal uses it regularly and really likes it.<br /><br />Again buy if you need a new hair dryer, otherwise you're probably okay.

I used the average of 4 stars to keep the rating unchanged.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE that a lot of these hair dryers do nothing more than mechanically lock out the on-off switch from using the HI TEMP setting WHEN set for 220 volt input for foreign countries.  That is very typical.<br /><br />PLEASE ALSO NOTE that the Low Heat mode at 220 volts does not work the same as 110 volts.  From an electrical point of reference, doubling the voltage yields a four fold increase in power (wattage).  If the Low Heat mode at 110 volts (USA value) is 400 watts, then using this dryer in Low Heat mode at 220 volts (eg, Europe) would generate 1600 watts.  That's the way the power equation works.  That's how my current unit worked when we vacationed in Europe.  Low Heat mode at 220 volts generates high heat and a fast fan speed.<br /><br />WHAT you lose is the low power curling and shaping mode when using these dryers at 220 volts.  There is no 400 watt option in the 220 volt setting.<br /><br />If you want both HIGH and LOW Heat modes, buy a transformer to convert 220 to 110 volts (and be sure it is big enough, power wise, to handle the 110 volt High Heat wattage).  The cost, beyond the purchase price of the transformer, is the added transformer weight in your travel luggage.<br /><br />I hope this clarifies how these type hair dryers work in Europe....  a retired Electrical Engineer.<br /><br />PS:  Going from USA 60 Hertz (a.k.a. 60 cycles) to European 50 Hertz makes no difference for this appliance.<br /><br />PPS: None of the 220 V countries use our 110 V two prong or three prong wall plug.  Even if you don't buy the transformer,<br />  you will need a plug converter kit to plug this hair dryer into the 220 V wall outlet (found with the luggage in most department stores or on<br />  Amazon under Plug Converter - but be sure to get the 220 to 110 version and not the 110 to 220 for Europeans visiting USA).",3/2/2011

When I came home to the States I just switched the voltage back and I now use it at home. It is small and takes up very little space in the suitcase. I would recommend it for anyone in need of a hair dryer traveling abroad.",1/5/2007

It's performance is decent (dries hair quickly with less frizz), but it's design and construction leave something to be desired.    Issues:  1) It's really heavy so be prepared for your arm to get a work-out when using it.  2) The placement of the cord retractor button is really bad. If you set the dryer down on it's side sometimes the retractor button will get bumped causing your dryer to slide across the counter.  3) About 1 month ago the on/off button popped off. I was able to stick it back on, but it will occasionally still fall off during use.  4) The cord retractor is somewhat dangerous and also will get stuck occasionally during cord retraction.  5) The placement of the cool shot requires you to hold the dryer awkwardly to keep from accidentally pressing it.    Maybe it's just a matter of preference in design, but this dryer has been  very awkward and difficult for me to use.

I did not notice that it took any longer to dry my hair with this dryer versus my older 1875 watt dryer.  I bought it primarily because it advertised the quiet motor.      It is somewhat heavy, but once you get used to it, it is no big deal.  I dropped this dryer probably a couple hundred times and it continued to work just fine.      Recently I noticed it was only blowing cold air and assumed that the heating element went out.  I was going to throw it in the trash.  Lucky for me, I didn't get around to it.  It is the perfect sleep soother for my now 8 month old daughter.  It was just loud enough to break her crying spree and get her focused on sleep, plus, since the heating element went out, we don't have to worry about her/us accidently touching a hot dryer.  It is amazing, we turn it on and she immediately plops her head down on my chest and is out like a light in just a couple of minutes!!

My mother-in-law has this model at her summer cottage, so I'd use it when we were there.  Typically, one doesn't put as much effort into vacation hairstyling, but despite that, my hair always turned out better while away than when at home.  Though it's quiet to the point that I hadn't expected much power from it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it very efficient.  It dries very fast, doesn't scorch your head, and adds a healthy shine, too.  I'm replacing my current hair dryer with this model.

Although this newer version of the Ion Shine hairdryer should have improved on the preceding models, it falls short of my older version.  The switches, which respond to very little pressure, are placed directly where I want to put my hand and it is inevitable that I end up accidentally switching the hairdryer off or changing the heat setting.

I am a short lady so the weight of the dryer and the length of the barrel with the attachment is a problem as well.

I purchased this dryer with the intent to improve the condition.  It does a FAIR job. I have had the dryer about 2 years and it hold up rather well considering the abuse I give it.  The dryer has very little power and I would say that drying time probably takes about 2-3 minutes longer than with a regular blow dryer.  If you have very frizzy or curly hair then you I probably would NOT recommend this just based on the power levels.  If you have wavy hair then this dryer in combination with either a diffuser or the accompanying attachment should would well for you.  It is a heavier hair dryer and isn't great to take on vacations.  The position of the ion switch is lousy - you'll probably find yourself accidentally turning it off just based on it's location.  Settings are either high or low and the same goes for speed.  I happen to use high but if you like variety you may want to consider another model.

I have generally been very pleased with Conair hair dryers, and the Ion feature seems to really tame the frizz.  However, the blower on this model is very slow, so it takes a long time.  Sometimes I have to pull out my old dryer to get the wet out, then use this one to finish -- otherwise it would take me 20 minutes to dry my hair.  Also, the high/low setting is for the blower only, which is useless since high is so slow anyway.  The heat is not controlable, except for the COLD button you have to hold down to get just air.  As other reviewers have noted, the buttons are terrible.  I almost can't hold it by the handle without turning it off.

I have bought conair hair dryers before and never will again, just because of my past two bad experiences.

When my old Hartman Protech 1600 hair dryer hit the bathroom floor, things weren't the same. Eventually, in a spectacular pyrotechnic display, it breathed its last.<br />Since I had paid 20 bucks for it way back when, I was ready to spend that much on a replacement. Much to my surprise, in the 10 or so years I'd owned that dryer, a lot had changed, and now the same money buys a lot more hair dryer, so with some dough to spare, I bought one of these.<br />Many complain that it doesn't pack the same wallop as other dryers but that's a case of perception versus reality. The Conair's barrel has a larger diameter than most dryers and its fan is quieter, so while the perceptible breeze isn't as blustery, it's still moving plenty of air. I know because I use an egg timer to count off 3 minutes while I dry my hair and the Conair never leaves my hair damp (a barber told me that after 3 minutes of blow drying, you're just toasting your hair and not helping it). If you MUST have that scalp-scorching pinpoint blast, Conair includes a concentrator.<br />Ions are all the rage in hair dryer technology right now. Purportedly, a stream of ions directed at your hair will neutralize static electricity and smooth out frizzy hair. Ions are also claimed to flatten out scaly hair shafts, resulting in more shine. I'm waiting for our good friends at Consumer Reports to weigh in on the benefits (or lack thereof) of dual ion ports, but after a week of daily use with the ion switch ON, I've noticed that my hair doesn't fight me as much when I brush it into place. Even when the static-charged Santa Ana winds are howling through sunny SoCal, my hair doesn't stick out like porcupine quills. And, yes, if I turn my head from side to side, there's a noticeable shimmer that either wasn't there before or I had never noticed it.<br />A minor flaw is that the power and ion switches respond to a very light push, but after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer. The dryer offers low and high air-speed/heat settings and has a cool shot button that cuts off the heater while cranking the fan up to its fastest speed. Cool shot is another feature that is said to set a style in place by cooling down the hair quickly.<br />So, whether ions really do or don't make a difference, the overall performance of the Conair Ion Shine is worth the price.ut after a couple uses you learn to position your hand accordingly after switching on the dryer.

The only problem I've faced is about 6 months ago the product starts to make high pitched screaming/squealing noises, and they are LOUD. I like to dry my hair upside down, and I can't anymore because the dryer is especially noisy (I believe the fan unit has come lose and shakes around in the barrel which leads to the screeching). Besides that, it's lasted a long time, and it's a great product at a price you can't beat. After 4 years my current one is probably unsafe to use, so I am ordering my second one soon.",9/8/2013

A beautician friend of mine recommended switching to a ceramic iononic conditioning hair dryer and recommended the brand Hot Tools. I had purchased a ridiculously over priced hot tools hair dryer and I figured you have to pay more for results. I no longer had dry frizzy hair after blow drying, it was silky, soft and smooth just like after the salon and I was overjoyed. Several weeks ago my hot tools hair drier broke. I couldn't afford to replace it so I looked for a cheaper alternative. I found this dryer for more than 50 dollars cheaper than the one I was trying to replace and it had very similar specifications, so I took a chance and I've never been happier. It does such a better job than the over priced professional hair dryer. My hair dries in nearly half the time. It's never been smoother or softer.<br /><br />The drier is much lighter than my old one and comfortably fits in my hand due to its ergonomic shape. It isn't very loud like most driers, instead of a high pitched whiny sound it's nice low whooshy sound. I always compared hair driers to sounding like a power drill... well this one doesn't sound like a power drill, it sounds like a device that blows air, like it should. The included attachments (concentrator and diffuser) are an added bonus. I've used the concentrator with great success and I haven't used the diffuser yet (since I recently cut my hair very short and only use a diffuser for my natural waves when my hair is long).<br /><br />For the price the blow dryer definitely exceeds expectations.

This dryer is really awesome, it drys my hair fast, doesn't seem to cause too much damage to my hair and I love the rubberized feel of it while holding it. It doesn't have a lot fancy options or anything, just your generic three heat levels, three blow settings, and a cool button. However, my friend is a hair stylist at a pretty fancy hair salon and when she stayed over one night and used it after showering the next morning, she came out of the bathroom to ask about the blow dryer. She asked how much I paid for it, and after telling her, she indicated that she couldn't believe how well it worked.

Anyways, I found this one and just used it for the first time with a completely wet head and I am so impressed, I can't even believe it!! I'm not sure if the ion charges on my old dryer had gradually worn out, or if the technology now is just that much better? But I couldn't be happier. It took all of 10 minutes to completely dry and style my hair and it looks amazing, with VERY little frizz and enhanced the shine too. My other blow dryer had been taking me more like 15 minutes. This Remington does have greater watts / power too, but even on the lower setting, my hair was getting dry faster and styling perfectly. I should also mention the design is really neat looking too. It does not feel as heavy (quality) as my other one and the precision (extra) part felt like it was made kind of cheap. But, of course! My other one was about four times more expensive. As long as this one doesn't break anytime soon, I am sure I will be VERY happy with it!

31595683,R2NOOUVMFL6MS7,732252283,5,1,1,Y,"A superb, solidly constructed hair dryer","This hair dryer is the most powerful I've ever used. It actually kicks when you start it, that's how much air rushes out of the nozzle. The warm air drying field - because of the dryer's unusual strength - is wider and more focused than any other that I've tried. The controls are remarkably easy to use. They require hardly any pressure, seeming to respond instantly when pressed. Ergonomically the Remington Ac2015 is well designed, fitting in my hand quite comfortably. Other hair dryers are often indifferently designed, their weight soon tiring your hands and arms requiring constant switching between left and right hands. This dryer stayed in my right hand without cramping or fatigue, which I really appreciate.<br /><br />The three heat settings and two speeds are perfect for the subtle changes your hair undergoes during the drying process. There's a big difference between the extremely wet hair you confront when first leaving the shower and the dryer, more responsive hair you have after a couple of minutes of drying. With the different heat settings and two speeds - coupled with the dryer's strength - I manage to avoid some of the heat damage that I used to inflict on my hair. Back then, I was forced to crank-up my inferior dryer in order to get better (and quicker) drying. Heat damaged, overly dry (even dessicated) hair is unmanageable and very unsightly. I am thankful those days appear to be gone for good. The attachments are easy to add and use though I never need them, finding the dryer in its native state to be best for my hair. The dryer runs quietly and without sparking, something that can be worrisome when your hands are moist. There's a four year warranty which indicates the confidence the manufacturer has in this well-made dryer.

I have short hair and the dryer dried my hair rather quickly. The two attachments the dryer comes with were easy to place on and remove.<br /><br />There are three heat and two speed selections. I found the  highest heat setting very hot, but it would be perfect for someone with long thick hair. The medium setting works well for my short hair.<br /><br />I have two minor complaints with the dryer: The weight of the dryer is a little heavier than I'm use to and  my 2nd complaint is with the placement of the controls. It made it kind of hard to hold and dry my hair, as I was trying hard not to accidentally change the settings.<br /><br />That will just take some getting use to on my part.<br /><br />Overall, the Remington Ac2015 Tstudio Salon Collection Pearl Ceramic Hair Dryer is a great product and certainly worth the price.",12/21/2010

They're all a little noisy but this one is by far the least noisy. It claims to make your hair shinier, too. Maybe, if you use it the right way. We've been using this for over a month now and it's hard to tell but we're inclined to believe the hype. Overall, a superb product so far.",12/16/2010

The hair dryer actually is brownish with pink details, contrary to what the pictures on this page may suggest (Black) It has a very 'girlie' elegant look, so the first impression was great.<br /><br />After using it for a while you can clearly tell this is designed for heavy duty, my wife owns a Conair hair dryer and this one is definitely quieter then the Conair one and more potent. It is indeed heavier but at the same time slim, basically it is not a big hair dryer but it is heavier than your average ones, not a big deal but worth mentioning. It has two speed settings you can use and three different temperature settings.<br /><br />Bottom line, a very 'professional' hair dryer, better than the old Conair the wife will no longer use.

Of all the dryers I've owned (including a T3) this one dries the fastest and leaves my hair smooth not frizzed.  I'm not saying it's going to perform miracles and turn a rat's nest into a Pantene commercial; but I use to run my straightening iron through my hair just to smooth it out a bit more, and I don't feel the need to do that anymore.",12/15/2010
37586596,R2FS8KO1N2MAYK,732252283,4,0,0,Y,One Powerful Hair Dryer,"The Remington Ac2015 is a good hair dryer with a reasonable price point that will get the job done for which it is intended--drying hair.  The hair dryer itself is very sturdy (and a bit heavier than most) and the controls are easy to use.  But is it possible that a hair dryer can actually have too much power behind the air flow?  If so, this hair dryer would fit the bill.   The Remington is a work horse of a hair dryer that has so much power for air velocity it was almost more than I would have preferred.  It blew my hair in just about every direction imaginable, and it blew papers on the ledge in my bathroom all around the room.  So therein lies what might be a potential issue with the hair dryer.  If you are a person who likes to style your hair with the help of your hair dryer, it might be a challenge to find a setting to do that.  While using the high speed setting on the hair dryer, with a round brush, my hair tended to blow around too much, and made it hard to control the hair in the brush.  The low setting was a better option, however, when I chose to use the cool shot option to set the hair, it made the hair dryer speed go faster, and blew more air than if you left the button untouched.  I am not sure why the airflow would increase when you hit the cool shot button, but that is what happened every time I pushed it.  It almost seems to be an engineering oversight.  Anyway, after a few days, I gave up on the Remington, for styling specific challenges only, and went back to using my Tourmaline Tools hair dryer, which I like very much.  If ever there is a time I just need a quick blow dry, I would certainly reach for this hair dryer, and it is more than suitable for general every day use.",12/14/2010

I had to buy a new dryer because I left my other one at mom's.  Knowing I'd be home to collect that one (which came from a beauty supply store and works well), I grabbed this one (cheaply) at Target. I think I more or less chose it because it was cute, but I've wound up loving it for more practical reasons.  I very much prefer it to the one it replaced.  One reason is tactile; it has a nice almost-soft finish that's comfortable to touch or hold.  Ergonomically, it simply feels right in my hand.  It's very well balanced.  The cool air option works great; far cooler air (esp for a sustained time) than any other dryer I've owned.  The air opening is a little bit smaller than average, so it provided well directed air.  (There is also a good diffuser included if you need to diffuse rather than direct.)  Provides a good and shiny and smooth blow out.  Quickly.  Even on cool air! The cord is NOT retractible, but is is a good length and doesn't seem to tangle easily.  I would recommend this product.",12/13/2010

The Pearl Ceramic dryer has the same features but is considerably lighter and works wonders with my naturally curly hair.

Even when I've used the highest settings on it, it takes me twice as long to dry my hair with this Remington than it does with my [[ASIN:B003521CA2 Conair 259 Infiniti Pro AC Motor Styling Tool, Orange]].  I have wavy/curly hair, so I usually use a diffuser, but I've tried this both with the diffuser and without it, and each time it's taken me awhile to dry my hair.<br /><br />Some other pros of this dryer are that it has a nice feel to it (the material that it's made out of has a pearlescent, matte finish), isn't too heavy (so your arm doesn't get too tired while holding it), and comes with some nice attachments.  The diffuser, though, has prongs that are asymmetrical in length, so it takes awhile to get used to using it.<br /><br />Since many of the other reviews are glowing and say that this dryer dries in record time, I'm wondering if I received a defective unit. As I mentioned, it does cut down on frizz, but I prefer my Conair for a faster drying time.",11/25/2010
51742815,RWZZ77PTTHCDV,732252283,5,2,3,Y,A Great Improvement Over Older Hair Dryers,"I have to admit, as a guy with short hair, I do not use a hair dryer very often.  However, I am all too familiar with the noise they make when my wife is drying her hair in the morning.  To me, her 10 year old hair dryer sounds like a mini jet engine.  I asked her to give this hair dryer a try.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is that the hair dryer did not wake me up in the morning when my wife was drying her hair.  The hair dryer does not have that high pitch noise that makes it sound like a jet engine.  It makes a noise that I have not heard in a hair dryer before.  I would call it more of a low roar versus the high shriek of the older models.<br /><br />My wife was very impressed with the effectiveness of the dryer.  She said that it dried her hair in about half the time as her old dryer.<br /><br />The dryer does feel like it was build solid.  The outside casing has a rubbery type feel as opposed to the hard smooth plastic most dryers are made of.<br /><br />My wife is thrilled with how fast it dries her hair.  Personally, I love the fact that it is quiet and doesn't wake me up in the morning when she dries her hair (I work the graveyard shift so this is important to me).  So far, this is an excellent product and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.",11/23/2010
51401810,R3HT7OGKQO8Q0E,732252283,5,10,14,Y,"Sorry, but it really did blow us away","I gave this dryer to the missus to try, since she uses one everyday and tears through one or two a year. I figured she'd be the perfect person to rate this against a number of other dryers. Here's what she said:<br /><br />First of all, this hair dryer looks sleek (chocolate brown with powder pink accents) and it doesn't look bad or distracting just sitting by the sink or on the dresser. (Some huge salon models that look like they power wind tunnels are much more obtrusive.) This one is rather long and slightly heavier, however, than the Con Air Infinity hair dryer I've been using, so it took a little getting used to the heft. The noise level is average (the same as Con Air), but it dries my hair much faster and seems like it gives more volume to my hair. The speed also allows me to style my hair better and it stays that way longer. While most blow dryers have multiple settings, this Remington really has noticeable differences between the settings, with warm being warm and hot actually being hot instead of a little warmer. The selection switches on this model are also much easier to change to get to those settings, and unlike most slide switch type models, they can be changed on the fly while styling without having to fumble and fret with the dryer. No doubt about it, I'm completely satisfied with this dryer.<br /><br />So of course, we give it five stars.",11/22/2010

But my wife has very thick long hair and uses a blow dryer every time she washes her hair. I've kept a close eye on her hair since she started using this dryer and I can't detect any difference either. So I asked her directly, would you pay $130 for this? No, she wouldn't. She said that it's not much different than her $40 dryer.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are two independent controls: temp and air speed. That's nice. I also like the fact that you can override the heat and blast cold air on demand. That's a great touch.<br /><br />But as far as the moisturizing and conditioning aspects, I can't detect them at all. I'm not typically such a skeptic, but when a product costs substantially more than the everyday version that I've been using for years, I need to somehow be convinced and wowed that the product is really worth paying so much more.

But surprisingly, my hair feels smoother and more conditioned than normal (as if I used extra conditioner or just done a treatment). The dryer dries quickly with strong blast without being too noisy. It looks sleek and, despite the size, doesn't feel overly heavy. The weight is well balanced. The cold blast feature works as expected. The issues I had was with the sliding button controls which can be a little stiff. Also, I have straight, moderately thick hair and the 'conditioning' effect sometimes flatten my hair. Hair can feel too soft that there's not enough 'lift' and bounce. This is great when hair is brittle and frizzy. Not so great on humid days. Curly hair may not have this issue.

29483495,R2B4V99KM24KTW,768062995,4,8,9,Y,Nanoe does make a difference,"I've had my hair dryer, a Conair mini, for ages--more than 10 years.  The Conair has only two setting (high and low) and did not come with any accessories.  So going from the Conair to the Panasonic Nanoe was like upgrading from a basic to a state-of -the-art hair dryer.<br /><br />The Panasonic Nanoe comes with a quick-dry nozzle, a set nozzle and a diffuser. It boasts 3 temperatures settings--hot, warm and cool, and a choice of strong (high) or gentle (low) airflow.  What makes this hair dryer special is that it produces nanoe or invisible water particles that cling to your hair as you dry it.<br />I have thick hair that reaches to my shoulders and when I used the Panasonic, I had the impression that strands of hair were separated. It boosted my hair's natural volume and gave it more movement. And my hair felt softer too after I used the Panasonic with the quick-dry nozzle and the diffuser.  My sister who has long fine hair also agreed that this dryer seemed to give her hair more volume too.<br /><br />Since I've been handling a mini dryer for years, it took a bit of time to get used to the full-sized Panasonic. At first it felt heavy, especially when I attached the diffuser to it, and therefore was somewhat awkward to manage.  However, I'm getting used to its weight and size and therefore doing a better job at styling my hair with it.  The Panasonic Nanoe does emit a smell, but according to the operating instructions booklet, it is normal and harmless.<br /><br />I'm glad I got this hair dryer. I like having the different temperature settings, especially the cool one because I want to avoid heat damage.  With my old dryer, I didn't have any other choice but hot.  After using an attachment with the hot setting, it may be warm to the touch so handle with care if you need to switch nozzles.  This is a great hair dryer. I don't quite understand the fine details behind the Nanoe technology, but these invisible particles certainly make my hair look good.",11/30/2014

My hair did not feel dried out at all after using this. The blow dryer has hot, warm and cool settings with a cool blast button. The back opens easily, so that any dust buildup can be removed. The weight is a bit heavy, but the design makes it nice to hold. I took off one star because the diffuser did not do a great job on my wimpy curls, but the other attachments worked out well for me.

My daughter isn't a huge fan of getting her hair dryed, and happily, this dryer reduces the torture time exponentially. I want to say the difference is in the diffuser, but there's more going on here. It isn't quite &#34;magical&#34;, but it's close.<br /><br />The &#34;magical&#34; part is probably with my wife's naturally curly hair. During the winter months, there's been some investment in products that control frizz, and I've been able to casually tell a difference between products. With this hair dryer, though, you'd swear some really expensive salon-grade stuff was used. The results are pretty surprising, and seem to last. I'd almost go as far as saying that this could save money, by reducing (or eliminating) the need for control products.<br /><br />At first, I was positive there was no way this hair dryer would be worth the money, but seeing how well it works with everyone in the family, I'd totally recommend it to anyone with curly hair, or who can't tolerate much time under the dryer.",11/25/2014

The other was an older BayBliss hair dryer, also with ceramics but no advertized ionizing properties. I didn't use a towel at all for the tests because I figured, if it works as advertized, the Panasonic should dry out my skin less well too. It seems to work.<br /><br />All three are very good hair dryers. I think the Panasonic did the best job of not fizzing up my hair and leaving it feeling very nice. HOWEVER, it stinks! It smelled like I was blowing melted plastic all around the room. That is not the case when I use either the Conair or the BayBliss. Additionally, while both the others are premium models, neither cost more than $50.<br /><br />I'm going to let the Panasonic air out for a month or so outdoors in the sun. Maybe some of the plastic stink will outgas and it will be a great hair dryer. Many people aren't as sensitive as I am to these plastic odors. If you love that new car smell, especially the smell of mostly plastic interiors after they have baked in the sun with the windows up, you'll love the smell of the Panasonic. I can't stand the smell of Fabreze or Bounce but maybe you think they're wonderful. If so, you'll think this dryer is to die for.<br /><br />I think they have the makings of a very good product. That nanoe technology seems to work. However, I'm concerned that each of those tiny little water droplets is surrounded by plastic particles, making it all the easier to find its way to my lungs. Hopefully, airing out will do the trick but I would still recommend a redesign to keep the hot air away from plastic parts.<br /><br />Addendum: I initially gave the product 5 stars but upon reflection I have decided there is no excuse for putting out a product that runs hot air directly past plastic when companies have been making hair dryers with metal or ceramic coated nozzles for years. Yes, recycling water vapor is a great idea, but don't forget to use the best of older technology as well. Plus a hair dryer this expensive should have a dual voltage switch.<br /><br />Update: Because of the smell, I gave the hair dryer away.... to my barber. He uses it frequently and likes it.

It is not the same as all the others.  I have straight, thick hair and have a hard time getting volume due to the weight of my hair making it lay flat.  I do blow dry my hair to give it some volume but it usually doesn't last long.  But with the Panasonic hair dryer, I get so much volume! It is amazing!  I don't know if it is due to the moisture being put back into the hair but my hair looks great and others have told me the same thing.  My hair also seems to hold the volume almost all day long which is unusual for my hair.<br /><br />At first the dryer took a little bit of getting used to as it is a bit bulky, but it is light weight.

There is also a quick-dry nozzle attachment that disperses air throughout the head and makes drying very quick.  I would only recommend this if you are in a  rush because I found my hair duller looking when I used this attachment.  However, there are days when a quick dry comes in very handy.

The quality is self-evident when you open the package and pull out this professional sized hairdryer.  Although it looks like it would weigh a lot, it is surprisingly light and easy to handle. The controls are simple on the handle, with one side of the switch for temperature, cool, warm, and hot.  The other switch is for high or low air flow, yielding 6 possible combinations.  The Nanoe comes with three nozzles, which slip onto the front of the dryer.  The Set Nozzle for precise styling, the Quick-dry nozzle for drying hair quickly and the Diffuser for creating full bodied hair with volume and styling.  The is also a Cool Shot button on the handle to temporarily turn of the heat, to allow time to style.  The dryer comes with a heavy duty 9 foot cord with a safety overheating/reset plug.<br /><br />The Panasonic has Nanoe technology, which takes moisture from the air and your hair and puts moisture rich particles, small enough to penetrate your hair shafts.  That's quite a mouthful.  What it did for my hair was make it soft and silky, and I can see nuances in the color which I didn't notice before.  The blonde is blonder, the brown is richer.  My hair dried quickly and quietly, none of the loud buzzing in my ear.  As I run my fingers through my hair, there is none of that dry, frizzy, overblown feeling with my lower priced dryers.<br /><br />For results like this, you need to make an appointment at a salon.

43966088,REKOCDKRELLWP,768062995,5,36,42,N,Great Hair Dryer!  Well Worth the Money!!!,"I have long hair, that is about half way down my back.  I've never been a huge fan of blow dryers and used to just let my hair air dry.  Lately my hair is wavier than it used to be if I air dry it, so it doesn't look as nice, and I've started blowing it dry most times I wash it.  Previously, I've only purchased a couple of hair dryers, and I don't think I spent much money on them.  I have been dealing with some flyaways lately too so when my previous blow dryer quit on me, I did a little research before buying a new one.  I never anticipated spending this much money on a blow dryer.  I mean, aren't they all the same?  I soon learned that the answer is NO.<br /><br />This is still a fairly new product, so there were not a lot of reviews to go by.  I did research on what to look for in a hair dryer.  It was pretty easy to decide that negative ions are a good thing when buying a hair dryer.  Tourmaline? Ceramic? Well, ok, but what about nanoe?  It seems that Panasonic is the only one using this technology right now.  Infuses 1000x more moisture into hair than typical ion hair dryers?  I was definitely skeptical when I read that.<br /><br />I knew that I definitely wanted separate controls for speed and heat, and the Panasonic EH-NA65-K has that.  I was also hoping to find a hair dryer that came with a couple of attachments.  The nozzle for my last hair dryer would come off sometime when I was using the hair dryer because it just slipped over the end of the dryer.  The Panasonic comes with 3 different attachments that snap into place and can be turned to whatever orientation you are looking for.  They are nice attachments!<br /><br />As I said before, there were only a few reviews out there, but what was there was nothing but great reviews.  What the heck, I decided to give it a try and I must say that I'm very pleased.  This hair dryer is quite a bit quieter than my previous one.  I also really noticed how much I am used to the quietness of this the last time I got a hair cut and the salon used a regular dryer to dry my hair.  It was way louder.  This also dries my hair much quicker, which is really nice.  With the amount of hair I have, it takes a while to dry.  Most of the time I am using the quick dry nozzle.  I also found that I didn't need to brush my hair while using this hair dryer.  I just dry it free style and my hair looks good and straight when I'm done.  As for the flyaways, it didn't completely solve that problem, but it does seem to make that better too.<br /><br />After using this hair dryer the first time, I thought my hair looked a little darker than normal, and figured that my mind must just be playing tricks on me since I know this is supposed to infuse moisture in my hair.  The next day, one of my coworkers asked me if I did something different to my hair.  I asked why they asked and they said my hair looked a little different color than normal.  I have natural red hair and have never dyed my hair before.  I couldn't believe it!  I didn't tell anyone that i was getting a new hair dryer.  That told me that what I noticed must have been true.<br /><br />To summarize, I am very happy with my new hair dryer.  It hurt to spend this much money at first, but now I think it was well worth the cost.  Now I just wish that Panasonic would come out with a travel size nanoe hair dryer.  This hair dryer is a little larger than a regular one, due to the nanoe port on the top.  Between that and just the weight of it being a full size hair dryer, I don't really want to take it with me when I travel.  I travel for business about once a month a really miss this hair dryer when I'm gone.<br /><br />Panasonic, please make a Travel Nanoe Hair Dryer!",9/19/2014

Once it is set up you must slide this terribly inadequate plastic catch up the back of the hood to hold it in place.  Oh and you have to do that after you are sitting under it.  So you have to reach up over and behind your head and the hood to fix (notice I didnt say 'lock')the hood in place.

Finally, on Christmas, it was mine!  I love this dryer so much.  It dries my hair SO much faster than any other dryer - even some pricier ones I've used in the past.  The best part is that it doesn't leave me a sweaty mess when I'm done.  I don't know if it's just the air speed, or the well-designed air flow and concentrator, but even though it can blast some HOT air (I actually have to back it down to medium heat when I have the concentrator on), I am not dripping in sweat when I'm done blowing it straight section-by-section with my round brush.  This makes me so happy!  I can wash and dry my hair and be ready for makeup in so much less time than I've ever been able.  It's no louder than average.  It's no heavier than average.  But it works so much better than average.  I love how you press the cool shot button and it stays cool, then push it again and it goes back to hot.  No more holding it down awkwardly.  I have accidentally pressed it a time or two, but so easy to press it back and move my hand down a smidge.   My hair is very fine and a bit wavy, and I have a LOT of it, so I really need a dryer that can get in there and start drying out the hair, especially in the back and at the crown, before I start sleeking it down with the concentrator, and this dryer can do it in minutes without me sitting around air-drying it for 20-30 minutes first.

The dryer is great -- high heat setting, powerful, cuts drying time by about 30%, leaves hair super shiny and soft, and I noticed that hair stayed that way for longer.  It's a bit on the heavy side, and doesn't have that grip coating that some of the other brands have. I give it one star because I was using it two weeks ago and it caught on fire.  Thick gray smoke with a burnt plastic smell.  I contacted customer service through their website but they didn't respond at all.  I don't think it's designed to handle the heat it puts out.  Nevertheless, I'm out a pretty expensive professional dryer that only lasted a year.  Will not buy this one again, but will look for one that's comparable.",9/7/2011

It took half the time to dry and no fly-away hair!!  I have gotten so many compliments.  I loved it but never thought anyone would notice.  I really do get such nice compliments.  Remember I am over the hill and hair seems to get dryer with the years and coloring doesn't help that except cover the gray which I am so happy for that.  But if you feel your hair is getting too dry and/or frizzy, fly-away hair --- this will take care of it. Its a one-time purchase and so worth it.  3-temperatures and a cool button which I love.  What can I say, oh it is not all that heavy, regular weight as other unless you want a little blow and a lot of noise from a much cheaper hair blower.  Been there done that... this is the BOMB!!!

My thick hair dries in half the time and has much more sheen to it. It has also cut down on the amount of time to flat iron it and extended time between washes.

I was initially skeptical on its claims that it cuts drying time in half and maintains moisture but its true. I have type 3C hair - which is kinky yet delicate - and it straightened my hair like a dream. Not to mention that the motor is half as quiet as the any cheap drug store dryer.

It is also very lightweight and much quieter than my previous Conair dryer.  Now to be honest, this is the first expensive dryer I have ever purchased so I can't personally compare it to others out there on the market, but I read every review I could get my hands on before buying and I didn't see any negatives where other expensive dryers (T3 for instance) seemed to have just as many unhappy customers as happy ones.

A lot of people say they can get their hair dried faster with this - I haven't noticed that. That may be because I have pretty straight hair to begin with, and while I have a lot of it, the strands are pretty thin. The biggest cons is the button placement - fine when I'm taking my time, but when I rush, I ALWAYS hit the buttons. Other reviews have pointed out no cool shot, but it does have three heat settings and I think the coolest setting is enough to set a style.

If it is on when you try to hang it onto the wall base, it automatically flips the switch to the 'off' position.

No problem since there are communal hair dryers I can use.  That day I found out how underpowered this HD was compared to other 1875w dryers out there.<br /><br />My hair is thick with a slight wave to it.  I like to get it as straight and clean as I can.  I don't like frizz, I don't go crazy with styling, I don't do the 'just out of bed' look either. I had been using this dryer for a little over 2 years with the concentrator.<br /><br />While true enough, it did dry my hair and I could get it relatively straight (as long as it isn't very humid), it took quite a bit of time and fussing to get it that way.  And by the time I was done, I had a bunch of small hairs going every which-way on the top of my head that I would need to smooth over with product.<br /><br />If I needed my hair perfect, like if we were going out, that means I left it in a Turbie for 30-45 min instead of my usual day-to-day 10 min.  That way it comes out relatively straight with little frizz (again, dependant on humidity) I guess if you take that into consideration, this works fine if you have loads of time in the morning.  Me? I like my sleep.<br /><br />Now, the air was hot enough but the amount of air that was coming out was not, even on the high speed (which it was on for 2 years!).  I wish I would have figure that out back then and exchanged it for something else.<br /><br />There were two features on the dryer that I could not tell you what they do, they never seemed to work or show a difference in styling for me: the Ion switch and the cold air blast. My hair dried just as slowly with the Ion switch on or off and the cold air blast was never cold or room temperature, it always just felt like the hot air was coming out.<br /><br />My other complaint is the attachments for it.  The diffuser and the concentrator.  I think I used the diffuser once but it suffers from the same, if not a little more, complaint.  The attachments are held onto the dryer by a little hump of plastic.  With any force, they pop right out.  Very frustrating when you're trying to get the dryer and a brush through your hair and the concentrator keeps popping off and falling on the floor.<br /><br />I did like the rubber hook on the base of the dryer, it came in handy for hanging the dryer on the side of my vanity when not in use (before I started packing it for the gym).

I kick it up to the high setting and become aware of a hot smell after a couple of minutes, but think that since I don't use this setting very often, it's just using coils it doesn't usually use- wrong!

The best method for achieving this was to use the highest heat and fastest setting on wet hair until the hair is damp, then to finish drying my hair with the air-flow nozzle on low speed and medium heat while using a rollerbrush to hold the hair straight and curl the ends.         I'd highly recommend this hair dryer. One thing to note: I do not notice any difference when using the ion switch (depends on hair type?).

If not once, then twice, sometimes even three times.  The worst part is that, once it falls off, it then bounces around the bathroom, making a HUGE clattering ruckus, before finally landing somewhere.

It just blows cold air. I thought mine was defective so I was actually perusing Amazon looking for a replacement for this dryer when I saw it on here and all the bad reviews. I decided to stop and put in my 2 cents worth.  The switches are terribly difficult to operate. I have to use my fingernails not my fingers alone. The retractable cord doesn't operate very well. But as another reviewer said, the folding handle is great. It's the only part that works the way it should. Also the attachments are impossible to stay on.

I really like the attachments, I can get nice volume in my hair. My hair is naturally very thick and frizzy. My hair is still frizzy after use ( I always straighten after with any dryer ), however, it is less frizzy then with my old con-air ion dryer.

It just snaps on, instead of having a twist lock or something-which means if you so much as tap it (say, with the brush you're using to style), the attachment flies off. EVERY SINGLE MORNING.

And it takes forever to dry your hair with it becuase it doesn't seem to get all that hot.  The folding handle and retractable cord work just fine, very nice for storage, and yes the cord doesn't really fully retract after the first time you use it, you're left with about 2 inches of cord sticking out.

This dryer has won me over completely. It dries my hair quickly and leaves it soft - again, having chemically treated, porous hair means that some dryers have left my hair feeling crunchy and looking frizzy. Not so with Deep Brilliance! I think it's a great product at a reasonable price - $40 is a LOT cheaper than most professional quality ceramic models I've looked into. For someone with damaged hair needing TLC, this is awesome. I can actually use less styling products thanks to the smooth finish I get just from the dryer. I didn't find myself wanting more power, as some reviewers have mentioned, but this may be because my hair is porous and not terribly thick.  The only negatives I can think of would be that the styling attachments become quite hot very quickly (thus you have to be careful when removing them right after use), and perhaps for someone with very thick hair, 1300 watts won't cut it.",2/28/2008

For starters, how can the product description say lightweight??? This thing is so bulky and heavy!! And because it takes so long to dry my hair with this thing, the heaviness of it sure doesn't help. It's apparently 1800 watts, but it feels like it's half that. I'm giving it two stars because for one, it's incredibly quiet and I've never heard a dryer this quiet and two, my hair was a bit less frizzy than with my previous ionic dryer. But these two pros aren't worth the cons. I don't see anything special about this dryer and my mother's 1875 watt Conair dryer beats this any day.    Also, has anyone done any research on this product? Google it. Have you noticed that it isn't sold in any salons, on the Farouk website, or anywhere else where you can see it's original $259.95 price?? I believe this is a cheaper, dumbed down version of a quality, more expensive Farouk product that has been released at a cheaper price so that the company has a range of affordable to higher-end priced products to widen their consumer base and profits. Nothing wrong with that, but I'm just trying to say that this definitely isn't some $260 dollar amazing hairdryer. The whole deep brilliance line seems to be a cheaper, more affordable version of Farouk products that are being advertised as if they are more higher-end, originally higher priced items. I dunno, try and find it somewhere where it was originally $259.95 or even for any other price. I sure as hell couldn't find it.

Mine only has 1200  watts, but I have always had short hair so that may have made a difference for the long length of time I've owned it.  But I have loved it since I bought it and I use it every day since I wash my hair  when I shower every morning before leaving for work.",8/3/2015

I wanted to return it, but between a restocking charge and postage it just isn't worth the trouble.  The dryer is much larger than it looks and would stick out from the wall approximately 6 inches.

12430910,RZ0USWSPBUNY5,983445543,2,1,1,N,Powerful dryer,"I bought this to replace an Andis Hang-up Turbo (Full sized) that lasted for 7 years. I was very happy with the Andis, but I bought the Oster due to it being off-white instead of white which looks a little more high end. I also got the Oster because it had smaller footprint because I installed a new medicine cabinet and I needed a wall mount dryer that would fit in a smaller space. So far, I noticed that it has pretty good blowing power, but it doesn't run as hot as the Andis did, which may be better for my hair so it won't get too hot.<br /><br />The only issue with having a compact hair dryer vs. my previous full sized hair dryer is that the back fan is closer to my head. Because of this, when I held the dryer too close to my hair (which is long) and some hair got sucked into the fan in the back. I had to stop the dryer and untangle my hair from the fan.  This is no fault of Oster, I just have to get used to a shorter length of hair dryer! Just letting others know what to expect. So far I am pleased with the Oster.<br /><br />ETA: It is July 2014, and it hasn't even been a year that I've owned this dryer and my Oster has already died! I'm going to request a replacement.",11/13/2013

No. 2 just died after 7 years' dependable service (the plastic fins on the fan became brittle and snapped off.) There's no use trying to improve on such a reliable product, so I'm ordering No. 3.
