51276712,R2U5A8P7ZZO75F,109226352,2,3,5,N,Junk! Do not buy!,We bought this microwave less than three years ago. It was handy and compact. It has now burned out in a spectacular and very dangerous flashing of fire and loud noises. Buy something else!,5/13/2015
25982682,REKMNME7NFLP7,109226352,4,1,1,N,... for about a year now and I am very happy with it,I've had this microwave for about a year now and I am very happy with it.  It fits in the corner of my kitchen counter and works just great for reheating foods and cooking vegetables.,5/11/2015
36658239,R3STZQPYKZJZX5,109226352,5,3,3,N,Best microwave I've ever owned or used.,"This is by far the best microwave I've ever owned, of any size or price, for two reasons: (1) form factor and (2) simplicity of controls. I use a microwave to heat leftovers, cook frozen meals, make popcorn, melt butter or cheese, thaw frozen meat, reheat cold coffee, freshen stale bread of make it into croutons, cook sausages and hot dogs etc. I use this microwave several times per day.  I think my microwave usage is pretty typical.  The only thing I don't do in the microwave is prepare entrees from scratch (like cooking a roast or casserole). I've cooked all sizes of frozen entrees with no issues. Note, my review refers to an earlier model of this machine, which seems identical to this one that has replaced it.<br /><br />(1) Form factor. Because the guts of the machine are under the cooking chamber, this has the smallest possible footprint.  And because of the rounded back, I have it tucked into a corner of the countertop. This means I lose only 1' of countertop, and furthermore it's an awkward part of the countertop I wouldn't use for prep work etc because my elbow would bang into the fridge. Every other microwave I've ever owned took up 2' of prime, useable countertop. This makes such a huge difference in the usability and appearance of the kitchen that I'd give it five stars for this reason alone.<br /><br />The interior size of this machine is bigger than you'd think because it's round and all the space is useable. The round turntable entirely fills the rounded shape of the interior. An advantage of this is that nothing falls off into the corners as it cooks. I've occasionally thawed something bigger then the turntable (the sides and front of the microwave are square so this is possible) and it wasn't a problem.<br /><br />(2) Controls. I love love love the simplicity of the controls. It does exactly everything I need it to do in a way that is completely intuitive and simple. I should mention I own an Emerson microwave in my office that I have never yet beenable to figure out how to operate (and I'm of at least normal intelligence). The hated Emerson has lots of buttons and I'm sure it does a lot of things I don't need, but none of that matters because I'm not willing to learn a complex and counterintuitive interface to cook a frozen lunch entree. This Whirlpool, however, is amazing.  It has Power, Defrost, Reheat and Popcorn buttons, as well as a Plus (+) and Minus (-) and a Start and a Stop. I accomplish everything with the Plus, Minus. Start and Stop, and occasionally Power.<br /><br />To operate, you can just press the Plus until you reach the time you want, then press Start. Bam. You can't get any easier than that. The time increments get larger as you increase time, and this is absolutely not a problem. It uses 5 second increments up to 2 minutes, then 15 second increments to 3 minutes, then 30 second increments up to six minutes, then one minute increments from there. This is fine; I've never had an issue where using 6 or 7 minutes instead of 6.5 minutes caused a meal to fail (my pot pies call for 6.5 minutes at 50% power, and they're fine at either 6 or 7.  When I make popcorn, I always listen to the popping and stop it when it slows. That's because popping times depend much more on the freshness and moisture content of the kernels than the power of the microwave; this is true of every microwave. Similarly, when I'm thawing something I pay attention to the progress of it because again, the fat content of the food and how hard it's frozen makes all the difference in timing. I suspect there are fancy convention microwaves with thermal probes that allow completely mindless use, but that kind of ultra high-end microwave isn't what I want or need.<br /><br />I've been using an earlier model of this microwave for three years with absolutely no problem. I can't speak to specific reliability of the model here, but mine is the same in layout of controls, form factor, etc, so I would not hesitate to buy this one. In factI'm very tempted to buy one of these for the office and get rid of that annoying Emerson once and for all.",12/14/2014

19554274,R2D3DACG6K35HD,109226352,5,0,0,N,Compact and Cute,"Little and cute, and it does the job. I use microwaves mostly only for melting butter and chocolate, and for making popcorn. We had gotten rid of a big, old one, but my husband likes to have one for reheating food, so we succumbed. Opening the door with one hand is difficult or impossible, but the price and the size are right and thus, a good review.",9/20/2014
47031541,R2J74BFOF8DPY8,109226352,1,5,6,N,Does not operate on an inverter!!!,I bought this micro to go on my boat because of its compact size and can fit into a corner.  Even rebuilt my cabinet on the boat to accomodate it. Now I have found out it will not operate on an inverter,6/22/2014
33032266,R1MQZFT428M8KW,109226352,5,2,2,N,thoughtfully designed,"I bought this because the counter footprint and wattage were both low. I didn't expect very intuitive controls, a super easy-to-clean interior, weirdly efficient heating (stuff gets hot FAST) and thoughtful design touches like an interior light that switches off with disuse, and a polite, non-obnoxious &#34;your stuff is done&#34; beep that only goes off a few times before quieting down. It's a great little microwave. Bit tall, but that should be obvious from the pictures.  Update: Died in 2017 after years of faithful service, and I'm going to replace it with the same model. It has a totally unmatched capacity to footprint ratio, and I'm really annoyed that no one else is making microwaves that stack the mechanical bits under or over the food cavity. This is obviously the better way to build a microwave.",11/19/2013

But my husband reported a big, scary electrical storm (and bad smell = burning machine?) inside the unit yesterday, along with a weird dark brown spot on the inside of the machine.

Today, the microwave is headed for appliance recycling.<br /><br />Importantly, we only used the unit at most once or twice per day, to warm or melt things.",10/7/2013

Its footprint is a winner, even though I got tons of real estate on my countertop already, I still appreciate how much space it frees up when compared to my big ass conventional MW. I do miss the analog dial (to set minutes) on my old MW though, touching these touch-sensitive totally flat buttons is just so unnatural.  I regret that I didn't buy this earlier.",9/16/2013

39140932,R3831T9HRDIFE4,242727854,3,1,1,N,Worked great until the door broke!!,"Bought this microwave in 2011 to replace a 30 year old Sharp Carousel that was given to us 20 years ago. The Sharp didn't heat evenly, but it lasted much longer than this one did. This GE microwave looks great and heats fast and evenly for the most part and I love the inverter defroster! But it is impossible to make good popcorn, no matter what settings I use it always ends up with lots of unpopped kernels and some of it burned. I wish the door closure was designed better. As with most modern day products, the plastic parts just don't hold up to everyday use. It currently only works if you slam the door hard. I have a feeling that its days are numbered and I won't be replacing it with another GE microwave!!",3/15/2015

Read the other reviews about its unreliability, GE's poor service, and the expense of repairing this product.  I should have done that before we purchased ours.  If your product is still under the one-year warranty, maybe you have a shot at breaking even.  Ours stopped working just a few months after the 12-month warranty expired.  If you're not under warranty, this is an appliance nightmare, which begins with a $99 service charge so the GE authorized repairman can tell you how much it will actually cost you to repair the microwave (parts and labor).  Not sure how you can ever cost-justify repairing one of these.  Update: GE told us it was not cost effective to repair the unit, but they did offer a $200 rebate toward another GE microwave.  Still can't recommend the unit.",12/29/2014

Bought all new appliances for a new cabin we built and used Consumer Reports recommendation to buy these appliances. This was one these purchases and was given an excellent review by the Consumer Reports people!!!<br /><br />Lasted just over a year and quit working. GE wants $75 just to look at it before telling me how much in parts and labor they will charge me to repair it. I can buy another company's 2.2 Cu. Ft. Stainless Steel Countertop Microwave for $89 today brand new with full warranty! Ah...no thanks!<br /><br />My old 29 year old Panasonic is still working great and heats food just as well as this one if not better. I think I'll take my own advice now instead of Consumer Reports and buy another Panasonic!<br /><br />UPDATE: Found out the inverter board is bad...GE wants $250 for a new part + $75 service trip charge and another $75 for repair = $400 total repair cost for a microwave oven just over a year old when one of these brand new is just under $300!!!,2/14/2014

I was at a local Big Box store and saw this on the shelf, decided to buy it on impulse.  After all, it's a GE and that's a great brand, right?<br />It was disappointing from the start. I don't use a microwave for much other that popcorn and heating freezer meals, and it couldn't even handle those. The popcorn setting burned the popcorn (my old, cheapo Sharp would always stop at just the right time.)  The meals were heated unevenly.<br />And now, after less than a month of very light use, the display flickers and it refuses to turn on.<br />After reading these reviews I decided it wasn't even worth repairing. I've junked it and bought a highly rated Panasonic from Amazon (along with a 3-year Square Trade warranty).<br />What a piece of junk!",2/12/2013
50181141,R2ZUTLNNXFQ8C,242727854,4,9,12,N,Great customer service while under warranty,"Warning:  For appliances, Amazon.com reviews are skewed to the low side.  Most people who write appliance reviews do so because their apppliance stopped working and they get mad and want to take it out on the company.<br /><br />The Problem:  most microwaves are made by a few Asian companies.  GE has stopped manufacturing most small appliances and even some major appliances.  Many of the GE refridgerators are not only made in Korea, they were designed and engineered by Korea and only have a GE label slapped on them.  The expensive GE Profile microwaves are made by the guys who make the Panasonic and other microwaves.<br /><br />With an appliance or piece of electronics, it can be the luck of the draw.  There is a basic reliablity curve, called the bathtup curve. In the first few months of a product's life, there is a high percentage of units that fail.  Then, if you get past that, there is a long period where the odds of your product failing is very low, until end of life is reached, maybe 10 to 20 years later.  The people who write reviews in Amazon are the unfortunate ones who products fail during that initial period.<br /><br />My microwave broke after 4 months.  But, GE customer service is great.  I called them up.  They came to my house the same day.  It needed parts the repair did not have on his truck.  He ordered the parts, which came 2 days later.  I made another appointment and my microwave was back in a week.<br /><br />This microwave is big inside.  I don't know how imporantant that is.  We can put big plates or platters in it.  But, if it wasn't so big, I could just put the food in smaller bowl.<br /><br />It has lots of heating options.  But, so do the cheapest microwaves.  Personally, I don't think any of those heating options are of any value.  It is not like they are reliable to work automatically.  With any microwave, you experiment a couple of times and then you konw what setting to use.<br /><br />Really, there are only 3 important features for amicrowave:<br /><br />1.  How it looks.  I think this looks great.<br /><br />2.  Power.  This is 1200 watts and heats food fast.  I wouldn't get anything under 1000 watts.<br /><br />3.  Quality.

The door didn't quite line up with it's case when closed and there were a couple small dents on the lower left of the door as well.    These were tolerable, however, as long as the machine worked - and it did... sometimes.    For example, from the start this machine would occasionally shut off mid-cooking, as in the timer would go blank, the light would go out, and the food would still be pretty cold.      Other times the food would seem to be heating up pretty well but then the machine would shut off.  On those occasions we thought it might have quit because it was getting too much steam on its sensors (wherever they might have been) so we would wrap foods extremely tightly with plastic wrap - still to no avail.      On still other occasions the food **looked** like it was being cooked (light stayed on, the table rotated, the timer counted down, and tone sounded at the end) but then it would turn out to be only ever so slightly warmer than when originally put in.    After a year of our just making do with this machine's cranky behavior and then just planning our meals without microwave use it died altogether.    My wife and I can only say, Good riddance! in response.    Consumer Reports lists this microwave as a best buy and, honestly, that's why I bought it in the first place.

Next came the refrigerator section not cooling at all.  We had to go purchase yet another refrigerator as we couldn't deal with our food going back all the time based on the reliability of this refrigerator.  Moved this GE refrigerator down the basement to use for excess drinks, etc. during the holidays.  Repair man just left after telling me it was too expensive to fix and he would not guarantee that something else didn't go wrong.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention, my GE microwave broke last week also.

I replaced it with this unit which I used for coffee, leftovers, and maybe popcorn heat ups; nothing like the actual cooking I did with the old unit with its regular and candy temperature probes, etc.  Between 2-3 years old it just crackled and popped and limped along for a day or two with a hard reset.  Dead.  The popcorn setting never worked (other microwaves I have used elsewhere did a great job) nor was the sensing mechanism impressive.  I also didn't like you couldn't use the timer independently when it was running.  Sure, it may be the magnetron but you have to pay to diagnose then replace.

GE only sells a control assembly at nearly $400 (the oven originally cost about $500). GE says their ovens are not consumer repairable and refer customers to a repair facility.

52952311,R13B85G4EK2M2R,242727854,3,13,16,N,Good microwave but GE must think it's a disposable.,"We bought this microwave (JES2251SJ02) in Jan. of '07. It works pretty well. I like the Inverter defrost capabilities. Recently (Dec. '09) the oven bulb (part# WB36X10302) burnt out. Not a critical problem but a definite pain in the a**. So far my choices in fixing it are:    1) Open it up and poke around trying to fix it myself. Carefully! There's reported to be high voltage capacitors in there that can permanently ruin your day and all your days to come. There is apparently no manual available that will tell you how do do this or what to watch out for.    2) pay for a GE technician to come to the house ($69) and replace the bulb ($12-$20 I think, the GE appointment scheduler doesn't know but I found it online for $11.75) PLUS LABOR.   How much do GE techs charge per hour? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say. How long will it take to complete the job? GE maint. doesn't know or won't say.   Let's estimate that the labor involved takes half an hour to pull the cover off and dismantle the thing enough to get to the bulb and replace it. If the tech charges only $50/hr (probably considerably more) that's a total of $106 (house call + parts + labor). I paid $233 for the thing new. I need to pay almost half the purchase price to fix a burned out bulb 2 yrs later? Time to think about not buying anymore GE appliances.",12/7/2009

Here's what happened.    Week 1, I call the service center, describe the problem I'm having (power cuts off after a few seconds) and the rep says it's probably an inverter board, and schedules a repair call.    Week 2, The technician arrives, diagnoses the problem and says it's an inverter board. He orders the part.    Week 3,The part has arrived, the repair guy comes to install it, but it's the wrong part. He has to order the right part, I have to take a third day off from work to be available,  and we have to go another week without a microwave.    Wouldn't the RIGHT thing for GE to have done is replace the microwave? Just ship us a new one, and have us ship the old one back? Or have the repair guy make the swap?     That would be showing GE cares about their customer's time, they're concerned if they waste time because of their error, and keeping customers satisfied is its top priority.

Ours is less than a year old and has failed--now, when attempting to cook, the unit shuts off before the end of the programmed time.

Like others, I purchased this unit based on the recommendation in Consumer Reports; this recommendation didn't pan out.  I tried to schedule warranty service and GE is making us wait a week to schedule and their frustrating telephone system does not provide information on where I can take it for service for faster turnaround (and didn't put me in touch with a live representative).    When the microwave oven worked, it worked fine.  We replaced a Sharp unit with this one; though this unit has the advantage of a larger capacity, its controls are less intuitive.    Based on poor reliability and poor service, we're certainly not going to buy another GE microwave.  We've had good success with GE refrigerators in the past; this is very disappointing.  A quick search on the web now reveals that GE microwave ovens are not reliable--many others appear to have similar problems with the magnetrons.

36356690,RDZCZ2A55NN9X,242727854,1,184,189,N,Larger and More Powerful But Short Service Life,"E. J. Tastad's review of this product is accurate and appropriate, but I would like to add some additional information.  I bought this GE Profile microwave oven in March of 2006 on the recommendation of Consumer Reports.  In September 2009 I am sorry to report that I had to throw it out because it wasn't worth repairing.  Consumer Reports gave this GE model their top rating for large microwave ovens.  It replaced an old Amana RadarRange that I had used for about 25 years before it burst into flames.  The Amana had also received Consumer Reports top rating back then.  If I recall, my Amana sold for about twice as much money (in 1981 dollars) as this GE costs in 2006 dollars.<br /><br />Since this microwave oven is more powerful, faster and consumes more electricity than small models, you may need to have a dedicated 20 ampere outlet available for its use.  Compared with my old Amana, the GE has a much more uniform distribution of heat when cooking or reheating, probably because the food is rotated on a turntable.  As E. J. Tastad found, the defrost cycle is easy to use, gives good distribution of heat and the front panel controls are fairly intuitive.  The stainless steel cabinet is attractive and easy to clean.<br /><br />Unlike my old Amana, this oven cannot multi-task.  For example, if you're running the built-in clock timer, you cannot cook or reheat something on a different schedule using different functions.  You must stop the clock timer to begin a cook cycle and vice versa.  You also cannot program several sequences of automatic operations as my old Amana could accommodate, nor can you program it to start at a later time.<br /><br />This microwave oven was not as reliable and did not last nearly as long as my old Amana did.  The magnetron tube in my GE Profile microwave oven failed after two years of use.  It's replacement was covered by the five-year GE warranty on the tube, but the warranty didn't cover the $85 in labor charges, which would have been even more if I had received the service on-site instead of taking the appliance to the appliance repair depot.  After 3 1/2 years of use, (September 2009) the main circuit board self-destructed.  It cost me $44 at the nearest GE repair facility to learn that it would cost me more than another $200 to replace the microwave oven's circuit board.<br /><br />Since other brands of similar-sized and power microwave ovens cost less than the repairs, I have discarded this microwave oven after 3 1/2 years and after spending $129 in diagnostic and repair charges in addition to the purchase price.

50768776,R2V5OQY4NUMHCV,242727854,5,95,100,N,Great countertop microwave,"Pros:<br />Large<br />Fast and Even Heating<br />Great Defrost<br />Not too loud<br /><br />Cons:<br />Sensor reheat is only good for soups and other substance that it is okay to heat to boiling (don't trust it with Pizza, or other foods like that).<br /><br />Bottom Line:  This is an excellent large microwave for countertop use.  The inverter defrost works almost perfectly every time, never cooking my food more than it should, but the reheat is a gimmick.<br /><br />This is a large countertop microwave, at about 2.2 cubic foot.  Coming from an over-the-range microwave this is a huge improvement in size.  The microwave heats uniformly and fast (it is 1200 watts).  The sensor reheat should only be used on foods it is safe to boil, otherwise it overcooks about everything else.  It also works best when you lightly cover the food, as sometimes uncovered food triggers it to turn off too early.  Lightly covered is critical, as the sensor works off water vapor temperature being released from the product.  If the water vapor cant leave the container it could become superheated.  Sensor cook should also only be used under supervision (you should be in the same room).<br /><br />I have had the microwave for about 6 months now with no issue.  It is no louder than other microwaves I have used, and the controls are intuitive and easy to use.  You do not have to press a cook button or anything to start your timed cooking.  My favorite feature is the inverter defrost.  Remember you enter the weight in pounds, so for an 8 oz pack of bacon you would enter 5 and start for 1/2 of a pound.  If you had a 1.5 pound package of meat, you would enter 15 and start for 1.5 pounds.  The display shows the weight correctly. Not much else to say about the product, it is a microwave after all.<br /><br />Update: To improve sensor reheat performance, use a lid over the food with a vent hole.  I use a paper plate with a small hole (finger tip size) punched in it.  This will make sure the reheat stays running long enough, but still gets some water vapor to judge the food temperature by so it doesn't over cook.<br /><br />Update (6/26/2010): I have been using the microwave 2 years now.  It has been no issue and still works perfectly.  I use the sensor reheat almost all the time for soups and casseroles, and use the inverter defrost for my frozen goods.  I also use the popcorn button to heat microwave popcorn bags.  Everything has been working great!<br /><br />Update (7/26/2011): Still going strong.  I use the inverter regularly for defrost, or lowering the power level to cook something slower.  It has worked well for me, and I think problems might be from shipping, quality control, or some other factor.<br /><br />Update (3/21/2013): Still going strong, but maybe a bit noisier now.

Repairman blamed the motor board? That repair lasted not even a year - same thing happened - burning smell, quit working. New repair company same fix. 8 months later the unit picks and chooses when it decided to work. Door pops open when you push start, buttons won't work. Closes then opens again. It's ridiculous.

That was when I was cleaning the bottom of the drawer from food that was stuck on. I made the mistake of putting too much water in the drawer using a wet sponge. I turns out that the bottom of the drawer is NOT really sealed for thin liquids (I doubt if food would get thru the bottom of the drawer). Anyway shortly after I cleaned it the drawer wouldn't go in or  out. It turned out that water had leaked thru the bottom of the drawer and found it's way to the motor that controls the door - the motor was burned out and had to be replaced under warranty. It took the repairman a month to get the parts (bad) .It was my fault but it could have been designed better to seal the drawer totally. So do not let a lot of liquid get on the bottom of the drawer as I did.. I also strongly recommend getting an extended warranty - things like this with a mechanical component will fail well before the electronics fails .Also it's ridiculous that it took the repair man a month to get the parts.,2/8/2015

For the first 13 months we loved this product, then the automatic open/close door feature stopped working. I called Panasonic and they were no help since it was out of warranty.

We shut the microwave off and waited a while and tried it again. Same thing only stronger smell.

I have called them twice and asked about a product recall, and if they were going to escalate the product defect issues to their development team.  No response.  It's obvious that their customer service teams do not close the loop and provide feedback to their engineering and business teams.  For this price, this is an unbelievable rip off.  Yes it looks great, but it doesn't work much more than a year.  Now we're stuck, with the prospect of paying for service, and then waiting until it breaks again.

Every appliance in our kitchen is new and this particular appliance is my favorite due to the uniqueness and convenience of this model. This microwave has exceeded our expectations in every way. One of the reasons we bought this microwave was that we needed a microwave that would fit under the countertop so our kids could reach it. It is also nice that the door slides open and I can reach down to lift out the food instead of having to reach up at face level and lift food out and down. I liked the unique concept of a drawer that pulls open instead of a door that pops open. I was a little concerned about reviews on earlier models that the auto open and close function on this microwave has a tendency to break. However, it seems that Sharp decided to manufacture this one so it closes with a button or by pushing or pulling on it to eliminate that problem. I was also concerned that it didn't have a piece in it that rotates the food. So, we were surprised to find that none of the food we have cooked has hotspots (note: I only use my microwave for reheating...not cooking). I LOVE this microwave. I had considered purchasing the 30 but decided that it was unlikely that I would need to put a dish in the microwave that was bigger than 24. So far, this has been the perfect size. It is even tall enough that I can put my portable mug in it to heat up my tea. Also, my lovely daughter did not know that you can't put metal in the microwave. She put her fork in with her plate. Surprisingly, the microwave did not arch. We checked the manual and it said you can even use aluminum foil to cover portions of meat. Not sure how they do it, but I'm not likely to try it. The microwave seems fine after the fork episode. This microwave also has programmable features such as softening ice cream. It asks what size of ice cream then sets the time as appropriate. It's a nice feature but I'm not usually softening a whole tub ofice cream. Just a portion of a tub. One other feature I use frequently, pushing the power button after closing the drawer will turn on the microwave in one minute increments. As an example, pushing the button 3 times will equate to 3 minutes. This is a pricey microwave but has been well worth the expense in our experience. I highly recommend this microwave!",10/29/2009

34296583,R2CZGB89UBS5ZQ,392967251,2,11,12,N,An almost immediate regrettable purchase,"I've only had this for less than a month and, full disclosure, I didn't purchase it from Amazon but got the exact same model from Best Buy (I should have read the reviews here first before it was installed!).    The good:  It looks nice; the stainless steel finish must have some kind of coating on it because it's much easier to clean than some of my other steel appliances; the overall size is decent on the inside.  When it's cooking, I have to say this is the quietest microwave I've ever owned.    The not-so-good:  I've never had an over-the-range microwave with the handle on the door before and I hadn't really given that feature much thought before making the purchase.  It looks nice and all, but the handle gets untouchably hot if you're cooking on the stove;  I don't think I'd ever buy another with a handle again because it's kind of a nuisance to have to use an oven mitt to open the microwave (even more of a nuisance if I forget to use a mitt and put my hand on hot stainless steel).  It's very hard to see inside of when food is cooking.  There's one bulb and it's quite dim, plus the door has a screen-printed pattern on it that makes it even harder to see into.  The exhaust fan for the range technically has two settings, but they sound almost identical... and it's VERY loud. If the microwave is running for a long period of time or if it starts getting overheated from the stove below, the fan automatically turns on.  It's a smart feature to prevent it from overheating, but again the fan is super loud, and you can't manually turn it off once it kicks on.    The bad:  Oh. My. God.  The freakin' beeps when it's done cooking are INSANE!  I've never, ever had a microwave that didn't stop beeping upon the door being opened.  Not only does this continue, but the 3 beeps are extremely loud and at least 5-6 seconds long each!  And if you don't open the door in a timely fashion, it doesn't remind you with a gentle, short beep;  instead you get the same 3 ear-shattering YokoOno-screeching beeps every 2 minutes.  I've found that if you hit the stop/cancel button before opening the door, it'll stop the beeping... but again, it's another nuisance that I've never had to deal with in any previous microwaves.    The other bad thing I've found is that the touch pad scratches EXTREMELY easily.  I only use a microfiber cloth on it and it still looks like I went at it with steel wool covered in broken glass.  I tried using a plastic/fiberglass polish and it didn't do a thing.  However, I've found that using granite countertop cleaner/polish at least minimizes the look of the scratches a bit.    Overall, I'd advise people against purchasing this model.  Its negatives outweigh the positives... especially when there are so many other, better choices out there.",2/25/2014

15443894,R387A2ZM3GISL0,392967251,2,3,3,N,"For a convenience appliance, I find it quite inconvenient.","I have been using this microwave for about a year. I will say the microwave works well as far as successfully heating items as a microwave should. Other than that, I find it to be an awkward design in the following ways:<br /><br />- The button for the light is directly under the &#34;Start&#34; button. If you hit the &#34;Start&#34; button, it automatically starts microwaving for 30 seconds. However, in a dimly-lit room, I often accidentally hit the &#34;Start&#34; button when I'm just trying to turn the light on. I can' tell you how many times I have started a 30-second microwave cycle on an empty microwave.<br />- Speaking of the lights there are two light bulbs underneath, which is fine. However, in the one year we've been using this microwave, the same bulb has burned out twice, while the other has yet to burn out at all. The first time, we had to scour the internet for a replacement bulb only to find that the specific wattage of the bulb that came in the microwave is pretty much unavailable. Anywhere. So we did some reading and learned to use a slightly lower wattage bulb. This took entirely too much research and hunting for what should have been a simple light bulb.<br />- The beeping at the end of the cooking (or timer) is quite obnoxious. It's 3 long, loud beeps, and, unlike every other microwave I've ever used, it does NOT stop when you open the microwave door! I have young children and often stand directly in front of the microwave, waiting for the timer to hit 1 second so I can stop it before it beeps so it doesn't wake up anyone sleeping/napping.<br />- There are lots of &#34;convenience&#34; setting (quick buttons), but I have never used a single one of them. Seems like a bit of a waste of space and features. It has a &#34;reheat&#34; button, but, unlike some other microwaves on the market, it is NOT a &#34;sensor&#34;/automatic reheat, so I'm not sure what the purpose of it is when you could just as easily enter the amount of time and hit start like normal.<br /><br />Overall, it looks nice enough and works as far as microwaving is concerned, but I personally think it comes with many flaws.",3/6/2013

52643790,RVF6011P8F0S5,423421857,5,33,34,N,Better than expected,"I purchased the Danby as a gift for my nephew who has a small apartment. I selected it mainly due to the price (less than 60 bucks at walmart) and the fact that it takes up little counter space. Although I was not expecting much in terms of features, I've been really impressed with this.<br /><br />It offers a wide range of programming features. There are 6 one-touch buttons so you can set 1 to 6 minutes of cooking time with one key press. It also has an add 30 seconds feature that can be used at start-up or while the microwave is already running. There are also a host of timing options for cooking and defrosting.<br /><br />It looks really nice - much better than I was expecting. Pretty decent stainless steel trim on the front and the handle, and a black casing. Looks like it cost a lot more. Easy to clean, and the handle keeps fingerprints away from the front. One difference from the picture -- the key pad is all black, and not white and black as in the photo.<br /><br />The 0.9 capacity is just right. I also have a 0.7 capacity machine, but that has a problem with any dish that's larger than 11 inches. The 0.9 gives you a decent amount of interior space, but doesn't take up much more counter space than the 0.7.<br /><br />It has 900 watts of power, and does a good job of heating foods quickly. The interior light is bright and comes on when the unit is running or the door is open. Reasonably quiet when it is running - typical noise level for a microwave.<br /><br />Can't speak to reliability as of yet, but it comes with a 12 month warranty that is extended to 18 months if you register it online.<br /><br />Great machine if you're looking for something that is small, but still very usable. Highly recommend.",4/24/2012
44961282,R3E4PBDQSB0PT,423421857,4,12,14,N,Not bad,"Not many reviews about this Danby unit. I replaced another 900 watt Hamilton Beach unit with this one. The main reason was the H-B unit light was off when the door was opened. Aside from that it was a good unit. I gave it away.<br />This Danby does have the interior light on when you open the door. This makes it easier to remove hot beverages without fumbling and spills. It is somewhat louder than the old one. It makes a humming noise when running. All make some noise, but this is almost annoying.<br /><br />At 900 watts you can expect moderate cook times. The table turns slower than others. The old one made one revolution in 10 seconds. This one takes about 13+ seconds. No big deal, but when heating a cup of coffee, the handle might be in the rear of the oven when finished heating. In other words, it was easier to use multiples of 10 (like 60 seconds) and have the handle of a cup right there in front.<br /><br />Aside from that it runs fine. No comment on quality since it too new to judge. At these lower prices they are pretty much throw-aways when they die. Like the other reviewer this unit was purchased at Walmart. I buy lots from Amazon and have alwaye been highly satisfied with service and products. It was simply cheaper at $73 total price with tax.",4/1/2012
20365751,R2285O38DIUTR9,423421857,5,372,380,N,Great microwave,"This is a great microwave. It works great and it looks beautiful. I actually purchased mine online from walmart, but I order from amazon alot and wanted to put my review here for all of you. I've had mine almost 2 months now. It has a 3 prong grounding plug. It's 900 watts and heats things up a lot faster than my other microwave, so I'm still getting use to that. I'm going to try and address everything I see people asking questions about. First off, when you hit a number, for example 2, it will automatically start cooking 2 minutes. You can press the start button and add 30 seconds. If you want a specific time, for example 3 minutes and 45 seconds, you can press the power button, then the numbers, 3,4, and 5.  It will start cooking 3 min. 45 secs. It has a lot of buttons for specific items like popcorn, pizza, dinner plate, defrost, etc. It has a normal hum when running. It has a turntable. The clock is displayed in green. It beeps 5 times, not super loud but loud enough, then stops. The light comes on when you open the door and while cooking. It has an easy to use child safety lock to lock the door. I've not had any problems with fingerprints on the exterior.The handle pulls easily. It has a nice weight to it. I have mine on a cabinet with grip bottom shelving paper under it, so I don't know if it would slide on a smooth surface or not, mine doesn't.  The inside dimensions are 12 in. wide, 12 in. deep, and 8 in. high. The turntable plate is 10 1/2 in.  Plenty of room for most things you microwave. For the outside dimensions, the width (side to side) is 19 in., the height is 11 1/2 in. The outside dimensions given for depth includes the slight protrusion in back and the handle. The actual microwave is 13 in deep without the handle and protrusion in the back. Here's the best way to let you know the depth to know if it will fit on your shelf or wherever else you put it. I have my microwave sitting on a cabinet which is 1 in. from the wall. I have it sitting 1 1/2 in. from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space. This means I have it 2 1/2 in. total from the wall. It comes out 15 in. from the back of my cabinet. The front legs sit back 2 1/2 in., which means that it is 12 1/2 in. from the back of my cabinet to the front legs. So, if your shelf is 12 1/2 in. deep, the legs would all fit on the shelf with the protrusion being 1 in. from the back of your shelf. I have the extra inch from the back of the cabinet to the wall, so if you don't, you might need your shelf to be at least 13 to 13 1/2 in. deep to give you more vent space. I think this covers everything. I think you'll be satisfied if you purchase this microwave.from the back of the cabinet. The actual protrusion is about 1 in from the back of the cabinet. There are vents in the back (and on the side opposite the handle-left side if you're facing the microwave) plus the protrusion, so it needs some space.

Just past the 7 year warranty for that part, so after researching several other microwave ovens, I will replace with the same model.  I hope they are using the same manufacturing process.  (One problem early on was fixed quickly and with full support of customer service, under warranty.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />I have used this microwave daily, usually several times a day for 8 years.  In contrast to one reviewer, my ceramic turntable is as clean as the day I got it. (Yes, I take it out and clean it whenever it gets a spill, either in the dishwasher or by hand.)  Couple of spots on the inside of the unit.<br />I like the clean appearance of having a unit without any handles on the outside.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not be the roomiest interior.  Listed clearly in the specs.<br />Exhaust fan doesn't seem to do much of anything, but I live in a NYC apt that is not set for external exhausting.  So my installation is a 'recirculating' one.

Sharp told me that I would have to get a service man out to install them.  The service man could not install them and he called Sharp and was told that there was a design error and there were no filters available for this model.  Sharp would not reimburse me for the expense of the service call.  Otherwise, it is a great microwave/convection oven.",12/29/2008
51736826,R1REOU1IZ0G4E4,459626087,4,33,35,N,Great microwave and convectional oven,"I've selected this model, because it is the only convectional microwave oven that fits my kitchen. Other models require some extra space in front of the microwave on the left side, to be able to open the door. It is not a problem for most kitchens, but if you have a deep cabinet to the left of the microwave that extends in front of oven, Sharp seems like the only option. Sharp has put a smaller door that starts about an inch from the left side of the microwave, so it opens freely.    So far I was not disappointed. I'm mostly using the microwave mode, convectional mode. It cooks well, and the menu is rather intiutive - what else do you need? Auto reheat works well and produces consistently good results. I was not getting very good result with mixed mode (oven + microwave) though.    There are some faults in this model, that I think Sharp should've done better, so it only got 4 starts:  1) The menu system could be better. E.g. the Start button on most microwaves also serves as 'Add minute' or 'Add 30sec', but here it would not do anything - one has to use dedicated 'Add minute' button. I got used to it, but my guests can't easily find this button.  2) The fan is very very loud. It has two speeds, but even with reduced speed, it is very loud. It does not look extremely powerful either.  3) The range light is generated by two small incandescent bulbs. I would expect energy efficient fluorescent lamps or LEDs for this high-end oven. They could've perfectly fit a long tube there, but have instead put old unefficient incandescent bulbs.  4) The interior is stainless steeel, but it is not very smooth, so it takes some effort to clean the microwave.",10/13/2008
51558013,R2WXEFZ3C0R8WA,459626087,2,10,11,N,Beware the Bummer Oven,"I had to buy this model microwave because my kitchen built-ins were constructed to fit an earlier Sharp model in this line. I loved the old one, even though it only lasted 9 years, but this one has been a tremendous disappointment.   First off, Amazon does not tell you until AFTER your purchase that they subcontract out delivery to a third party who prohibits you from speaking with the driver via his cellphone and thinks nothing of dropping the ball re customer communication: I wasted an entire day waiting for a delivery man who did not ring my bell as instructed and had instead delivered it to my super, which no one bothered to tell me. The delivery was an extremely frustrating fiasco.  Amazon needs to take more responsibility vis a vis decent delivery services.   Next point of disappointment:  I paid two men to install this monster.  (It's practically 80 lbs. and impossible to install solo).  So they get it in and fitting properly into the drop-in shelf designed to hold it. Then comes another surprise: Every time I turn it on, it makes a tremendous rattley racket not unlike a jet turbine - nothing at all like the smooth, quiet operation of its predecessor. This noise is so loud you can't even think about listening to NPR or a fellow kitchen occupant during the oven's operation. If I press firmly on the door of the microwave while it's on, the noise mutes, but who can stand in front of the microwave pressing on it every time you  zap a potato?  I'm not sure if the ace delivery company rattled something loose inside this particular appliance, or if this series model contains a design flaw, but the noise is really horrible.   There's more: I was very impressed with the ease of baking in this oven - the programming is  simple enough for a liberal arts major to grasp quite easily. But every time I use the convection function (closely following all the instructions re appropriate containers, elevating the foodstuffs off the rotating plate, etc.,) the oven gives off a menacing odor exactly like you sniff in a terrible electrical fire. There is nothing in the manual concerning either the noise issue or the smell issue.   I'm in NYC, where there are very few options when searching for a specific appliance (I tried to find one locally that would fit my shelf space), but if I could have, I would have previewed this model at a local retailer and seen how it worked there before springing for such an expensive lemon. Because this behemouth is such a hassle to remove and install, it's the kind of thing which, if you do buy it, you should buy with a guarantee of local on-site service. So far, this oven's cost me $1,000.",10/12/2008

I do recommend that you open the box and inspect immediately upon delivery, especially if it is during the holiday season when shippers use a lot of inexperienced people. Our first unit's box externally seemed fine but the interior packing was pulverized and the unit was obviously busted up.  Amazon replaced it and our second unit is still running strong.     I love this - I could write a tome.  The convection oven not only bakes and roasts, but setting at 100 degrees, I use it for raising bread, and 150 degrees, I'll bring a steak or roast up to room temp before searing and cooking. I think at 150 degrees it's faster and safer than having it sit on the kitchen counter as recommended in my cookbooks. I'm a better cook!    One warning about a dual-use appliance like this, which should be obvious: when you are using it for one thing it is not available for the other.

I found that it was bent on the bottom, bent on a piece of stainless steel across the front and the vent damper that came inside the oven was damaged. This appeared to be a factory sealed unit. <br />It had to come from the factory like this. Possible the bottom was bent somewhere in shipment ranging from the factory to the shipper. Since I got it on Friday, I went ahead an installed it thinking that Sharp would simply send me the parts as they were screw on simple replacement parts. I was wrong. First Sharp said they did not warrant cosmetic damage. I told them it was factory shipped that way, please send parts. They said NO! Ship it back to who I bought it from. I, after much argument, had to take it down and send it back. This ended up costing the seller shipping charges which they paid. I felt this was not right as Sharp could have easily fixed the problem. The shipper did not have another unit in stock, so I got a refund and ended up buying another brand locally. The foam in bottom of carton was very thin (none in middle), thus, subjecting the unit to shipping damage. I had a Sharp before this one that never gave any real problems, but their customer service really sucks!  <br /> <br />My advise to you is to carefully check ANY microwave oven you buy before you leave the store or install it.

I've found that in the heat of the summer I can use this oven vs. my gas oven and it cooks faster and doesn't heat up the house as much.  There is also a function that combines microwave and convection cooking to get meals done even faster... there are so many things this machine does, I've yet to figure them all out.<br />A nice feature, you can turn the turntable on/off depending on whether you have a round or rectangular dish.<br />The unit runs on regular 110 voltage, so no complicated rewiring.<br />GE, Kenmore and Samsung all have similar units -all made in Korea, all for the same price or more.

49333634,R3UMRU0YZF8TNP,464779766,1,7,10,N,Don't even think about it,"This was bought as an emergency replacement for a wonderful Sharp combo oven.  The convection circulating fan had failed, and there was no time to have it repaired.  The fan motor simply needed to be replaced.  The microwave function still worked perfectly, but I needed the convection oven for holiday baking.  It was just before Thanksgiving and I couldn't find a replacement of the the Sharp locally, and no time for an on-line order.<br /><br />I found this Samsung locally, and it looked like it would fill the bill.  It did save me from holiday disaster, but I've been far from pleased with it.  You have to memorize ridiculous sequences of the controls that offer you only numbers as feedback so the manual near at hand is essential.  It will only accept two entries for sequence cooking; I used three much of the time in the Sharp for extraordinary results cooking rice and polenta.  Now I have to enter the first two stages, then the third after the first two are finished.<br /><br />The temperature of the convection mode is incredibly erratic; I set 200 degrees and when I checked the oven temperature during cooking it was at 350.  Today I set it at 400 (the maximum) and it never got above 350.  I think the control circuit board is failing because I looked at the clock when it was 6:12 and the oven clock read 10:something.  I reset the clock, then looked at it this evening at around 8:30 and it read 1:something.<br /><br />The only good thing about the appliance is that the beeper can be shut off.

19812610,R3ROW1FM562STG,464779766,4,5,5,Y,A Multi-Function Unit that is surprisingly good but not perfect! (The preheat setting is problematic to say the least),"I picked this unit up primarily for the Convection Oven function but have come to really appreciate its versatility. That said, the unit is not without issues.<br /><br />The short story is: the microwave function works perfectly and is perhaps a bit more powerful than my built in unit. The grill function is great - provided you use the pan that comes with the unit. The convection function is wonderful but never and I mean never use parchment paper in the unit. (FIRE!) The preheat function is problematic and 7 time out of 10 will cause your unit to stop working for at least 15 minute after it shuts off, especially if you interrupt it when it is the 10 minute post preheat time frame to try to use the convection oven setting. The unit is very sharp looking and feels solidly built. The two racks and accompanying pan are also reasonably well made.<br /><br />Now for those who are interested, the long story:<br /><br />Microwave:<br /><br />Works just great, seemed to have more power than my built in unit so I did a boil water test and found it got the water percolating about 30 seconds faster than my primary unit. The kids and I have learned to dial the time back when we use this unit.<br /><br />Grill:<br /><br />Love this feature, I made the following - Grilled Cheese (upper rack and pan - 7 minutes with flip at half way point) turned out beautifully. Open face bagel with cheese (upper rack and pan - 5 minutes) grilled to perfection.<br /><br />Convection Oven:<br /><br />I had pretty good but not perfect results here: Baked Russet Potatoes (medium) were only partially cooked after 30 minutes when cooked at the maximum 400 degree setting, my convection oven cooks them much more completely in the same amount of time at the same setting. Sweet Potato Fries were kind of a disappointment as well, they just did not crisp up like they do in my standard convection oven. Chicken Breasts and battered shrimp cooked in here were done more to my satisfaction but I did note that Ineeded to keep the temp up about 25 degrees hotter than my standard oven to get the same result. French bread pizzas were a complete disaster when cooked on parchment paper - the paper caught fire. I checked the manual about using parchment paper - I use it all the time in my standard oven for all sorts of baking - and there was no warning about using it - but I can tell you it is a big no-no.<br /><br />Preheat Function:<br /><br />Well, this function is pretty worthless on my unit. I have successfully been able to use it and then cook exactly 2 times out of 10 in the 2 weeks I have had the unit. The first time we used this function the house smelled like it was on fire, the unit quit working and we thought it had burned up. The next time we used it, it cycled through the preheat and then the 10 minute after preheat time period and then shut down. (It completely turns off, including the time display and will not work at all.) The next time I let it cycle through (both the preheat and 10 minute cycle), the unit remained functional and I was able to convection bake afterwards. Then the hubby ran the preheat and interrupted the 10 minute after preheat cycle to attempt to convection cook - the unit shut down again. As I said, we have tried this 10 different times and never been able to use the convection function directly after the preheating is done. Even waiting after the 10 minute period of time is dicey, sometimes the unit remains functional, sometimes it shuts down. The hubby is frankly worried about this and so we never leave the kitchen when the unit is in use.<br /><br />Slim Fry:<br /><br />We have not tried this function yet but I will update when we do, perhaps this is the answer to my issues with oven fries!<br /><br />Overall, this is a better multifunction machine than I thought it would be. I was highly skeptical of the convection oven side of the equation as my prior experiences with these sort of units (toaster oven/convection oven) have lead me to conclude that they are okay at best. The oven on this unit really does a decent job with some finagling on the temperature side. (Ignore the standard advise to lower by 25 degrees vs. regular oven on this unit and you should be fine.)  For the price the unit seems a solid investment, my only reservation being the preheat function which I think I will just chose to not use going forward.<br /><br />Recommended with above reservations.",1/16/2015
51401810,RKXNZX22HQZEE,464779766,3,182,192,Y,Takes your chef skills down a few notches,"I’m always leery of appliances that blend several functions or operations into one device. My past experience has been that it is better to get one appliance that does one thing well than to get one appliance that does three things mediocre. But one thing I can say after running this Samsung multi-function baking, broiling, microwave, convection oven through its paces, is that it really does everything very, very well. Because the interface is not intuitive (more on this in a moment), you will have to spend some time with the manual to figure out how to cook things the correct way or the way you want to. You will also have to extrapolate a little bit, because Samsung does not cover every possible foodstuff and every possible cook method. Still, by keeping the manual handy, I didn't have any problem making delicious food in any of the modes that I tried (everything except broiling – which looks like it would be quite messy).<br /><br />I started simple, with the microwave. While every microwave that I have touched in the past twenty years was literally self-explanatory, just choose a setting or power level and cook time, this Samsung oven requires you to select the type of food, the weight, what you are trying to accomplish (heat, defrost, etc.) and it calculates everything for you and runs it. Now, this sounds like a lot of tedious work, and in fact it is. But the first thing I defrosted was frozen Japanese sticky rice. In a regular microwave, I usually just put it in at high level for a minute, stir it up, and I end up with a sometimes mushy, sometimes not, sometimes cold, or cool, or hot, sometimes perfect, sometimes inedible bowl of rice. Using the bread setting on the Samsung, I put the rice in, pushed the buttons and turned the knobs according to the instructions, and I ended up with perfectly defrosted, not hot, not cold, not a grain neglected bowl of rice. It was, in a word, amazing: defrosted without even getting hot. Wow. The microwave continued to impress in this fashion: popping popcorn, defrosting frozen berries, warming cold bread, all to perfection.<br /><br />For baking or actual heating, again, following the instructions of the manual, I made a number of excellent dishes. What I failed to notice, however, was that the cook times for everything I made were predetermined by the oven. That is to say, before starting I never knew how long anything would take and in fact, until you push the start button, the oven never indicates the cook time you are in for. Because these were main dishes and the length of time was not egregious, this didn't matter for the most part, until I tried the slim fry function.<br /><br />Now, I have experience with these so called “oil-less” fryers, which is essentially what the Samsung oven turns itself into in the slim fry mode. So, I prepped my potatoes and waited for my wife to come home before starting on the main dish prep, but before I did that, I started on the potatoes. The first step was to fast preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and it has a dedicated mode for accomplishing this. I turned it on and set to work on my other dishes. Eight minutes later, I was ready to go, but the oven was still fast (?) preheating. I cut to the chase, put in my potatoes on the crisper tray, set it on the small rack that came with the oven (is there a reason why the tray does not sit in a fixed position on its sister rack?), selected my quantity and hit start. The timer promptly displayed a cook time of 32 minutes. Wait, 32 minutes? I could drive to McDonald’s, order fries, sit in the parking lot and eat them, go back in and get another order of fries and take them home to serve with dinner and I’d still have 5 or 10 minutes before my slim fries were ready with the Samsung. We had a fry-less dinner, and slim fries (admittedly, delicious, crispy and light fries) for dessert.<br /><br />I don’t know a serious chef who doesn't work within given time constraints. It’s part of the task after all. (There are even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.) So if you ask me, how, exactly, is a chef supposed to get the most out of this Samsung, I have to answer honestly, I have no clue. Not knowing the cook time up front is a serious handicap. I suppose if you used it enough for a wide range of foods under an extensive range of conditions, and kept notes along the way, you could develop an accurate chart of cook times that would allow you to get the most from this oven. But as it is, I think this is a nice microwave with a lot of great features that is hard to use for much of anything else. Samsung has some good ideas and a great microwave, but with the quirky implements, required-reading manual and the “we’ll let you know when it will be done when we’re ready to let you know” feature, it is impossible to rate this any higher than three stars.e even television shows on which cook time determines the success or failure of the celebrity chefs competing on the shows.)

51718901,RPNCLJWGOLNS2,464779766,5,3,4,Y,Exceeds expectations,"Setting it up it is the only issue.  It is very specifically for counter-top use only and it has an EXTREMELY short cord.  The cord doesn't even reach to the far side of the microwave.  Expect to need an extension cord.  The unit is a tiny bit smaller than average, but not much.  It has a pull down door that doesn't lay flush when opened, which may be a problem for larger dishes, but I've yet to encounter an issue.  There is an internal light that turns on when the unit is operating and when the door is open.  It runs a lot quieter than any microwave I've ever seen, and does so in all four modes (microwave, convection oven, air fryer, and toaster oven/grill).  There is no timer, which I found odd, but I've been using the phone for that for so long, I barely notice.<br /><br />The settings make it super easy to use.  You can auto-reheat a dinner plate or a casserole with a single feature.  There is a convenient popcorn button.  I've heard stories of a friend without that feature trying to pop up a bag of microwave popcorn.  Six people.  One microwave.  No viable popcorn.  No such problem here.  One button and let it pop.<br /><br />There are also auto-cook features for pasta, beverage, chicken breast, frozen breakfast, and frozen dinner.  What? No frozen lunch?<br /><br />The air fry (or slim fry, however you want to call it) feature worked well for me, though I only tried homemade french fries.  It only works for this list of pre-programmed items:<br /><br />Frozen oven chips (aka french fries)<br />Frozen breaded prawns<br />Frozen chicken nuggets<br />Frozen potato croquettes<br />Frozen onion rings<br />Chicken wings<br />Homemade french fries (there is a recipe in the guide and it's good to read it first if you've never air fried these before)<br />Potato wedges<br />Drumsticks<br /><br />For using it as a toaster oven, or grill (it seems like they use the terms interchangeably) you put the thing you want to toast/grill on the high rack (included, as is the lower rack) and select grill.  For medium dark toast, I go three minutes on each side.  It comes it shockingly good, same as from any toaster.  I had low expectations for that one, but it worked really well.<br /><br />Overall, it does everything it says it does, and it does it very well.",1/8/2015
32483321,R2T6PILHX8VPIR,464779766,4,2,4,Y,"Really like the microwave, a bit torn on the other features","First off, my family and I are very happy with the microwave portion of the Samsung Counter Top Convection Microwave.  It looks great in our kitchen and the stainless steel matches our major appliances.  The black ceramic interior is also a nice touch - looks great and should be easy to clean.  The turntable is a bit larger than that of the countertop microwave it replaced, and in operation the microwave is very quiet.  One downside of this particular unit is it isn't the most powerful microwave out there - rated for 1000 watts compared to other 1200 and 1250 watt microwaves in this price range.  However, it is sufficient for home cooking tasks.  Setting the power and time is easy.<br /><br />The other function we've tried is the convection oven.  We used it to cook some frozen hors d'oeuvres (fancy name for pigs in a blanket) using the included metal racks and ceramic crusty plate.  Even though we preheated the oven as directed, we found we had to cook our food far longer than expected based on the time listed on the package, so there was no real time savings over using our conventional oven.  In addition, the exterior of the unit becomes *very* hot when using this mode.  I suspect that we will not be using the convection mode very often, though it is a nice feature to have.<br /><br />As for the Slim Fry / grilling / combined cooking modes, I have not tried these yet and I'm not sure I will.  These modes *seem* to use both microwave and convection heating, but it isn't clear how much of each from the very short included manual.  It is also very unclear when the included metal racks and crisping plate should and should not be used.  (Even looking through reviews and questions here you can see that Samsung is giving very inconsistent information on this subject.)  In any event, I will take other reviewers word for it that Slim Fry is a mediocre substitute for actual frying.  As for grilling, the grill elements only reach the back third of the oven, and I'm not sure it is worth the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven.<br /><br />So overall I would give this Samsung four stars for microwave cooking, three stars for convection cooking, and two stars for the other functions.  Four stars overall since it does its main job very well.h the inevitable mess created to try grilling in this oven.

39220433,RTSIB49LN0D2L,464779766,4,3,3,Y,It comes with metal racks? What next? A TV without a dial?,"To address the leading question:<br /><br />Yes, metal racks. That work, during the use of the microwave function. And the universe does not condense into a singularity and explode. What else from my childhood has changed? Do you no longer have to turn the dial on a phone to make a call? Drop a dime in the slot to call someone from a payphone?<br /><br />Anyway: yes, there are metal racks for the microwave and the other function. Follow the instructions.<br /><br />Here's the skinny:<br /><br />This is more than just a microwave. You can see in the description all of the functions--and they all work pretty close to as they are described.<br /><br />That's the first real issue with the &#34;Smart Oven,&#34; as the box labels it: the descriptions on the webpage here? They're almost as complete as the instruction manual. There's a bit more, but overall I would have liked a bit more in terms of device ideas and how to utilize it. Especially with the concepts/cooking types involved. I think the Slim-Fry concept is great, but I'd like to understand how it's working better so that I can do more than chicken wings and fries.<br /><br />You will also note several comments on the lack of timer. It's true: no &#34;non-cooking timer.&#34;<br /><br />In exchange, though, you can actually generate a crispy crust on that microwave pizza.<br /><br />The drop-down door is nice, but keep it in mind as you handle placement. On a countertop, it drops down flush but this does require that the oven is a little taller than my previous microwave.<br /><br />Functionally, I'd like a better option when using the grill or Slim-Fry settings than letting the grease/food drippings to just drop down onto the turntable. Especially because that thing gets wicked hot (as is reasonable) so you have to wait a while to pull it and clean it.<br /><br />But the functions work well, so that's the main thing.<br /><br />In all...great oven.

39699233,R2K45IY0NO70ZI,464779766,5,116,122,Y,Awesome Convection Microwave Oven!,"Before this microwave found its place on my counter this week, I hadn't known how much I would love it!  It heats food quickly, is easy to use (once you review the manual), and can serve the same functions a microwave and toaster oven do.<br /><br />What makes this microwave different...<br />+ It has many possibilities.<br />+ Pizza is crispy on the bottom (when reheated) even on the microwave setting!<br />+ It can be simple, or you can dive into all the stuff it can do!<br />+ The size is comparable to our old 1.1 cu ft microwave, yet it can do more.<br />+ The colors are awesome!  The stainless is only on the front (which makes for less to clean) and the gray top and sides are not stainless---so they will keep cleaner.<br />+ The dials and quick microwave settings are smart.  To reheat something for 30 seconds, just press the button on the bottom right (once for 30 seconds, twice for a minute, etc.).  Or, press the microwave button, turn the dial to the time you'd like (backwards or forwards) and then press the start button.<br />+ The clock setting is easy to set.<br />+ The convection oven works for settings up to 400 degrees.  Preheat the oven first, and then select the convection oven.  You'll need to read the directions in the manual first, but then it's easy to navigate from there on out.<br />+ The oven includes a crispy plate, two wire racks (that worked great on the convection setting), a glass plate and ring.  I baked some cheese onto the plate while using the convection setting and it cleaned up super easy.<br /><br />What may concern you...<br />-  The microwave does need to be on a sufficiently powered circuit (not on a power cord).  It does not have a long cord, so you need to be able to place it right in front of the outlet you are going to use or close to it.<br />-  Don't use plastic plates that are not microwave safe.  One review for this microwave was mistaken--they said you couldn't use plastic in it.  Not true.  You just have to use microwave safe materials.  There's a thorough and easy to reference list in the manual (which is located inside the microwave oven when you unpack it).<br />- The oven does have a heating element on the top because it is a convection oven, so you will want to make sure you have a microwave safe plastic cover that you can use when you are microwaving.  Otherwise, it's going to be a pain to clean it up.<br /><br />Other matters to address...<br />It's always interesting to read other people's reviews.  One reviewer didn't like the manual, because a cookbook wasn't included.  Honestly, I've gotten so many cookbooks over the years with appliances and I've never used them.  The manual for this oven seems small, but it is packed with all the essential information you'll need to use it--and more.  No recipes, but all the guidelines for cooking vegetables, reheating foods, etc.  I don't cook in my microwave oven normally.  I did bake spinach artichoke dip in this oven, though, on 375 degrees for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly!<br /><br />Another reviewer lamented the lack of a timer on this microwave oven.  That's not true actually.  If you use the microwave function, the time counts down normally.  If you use the convection setting, you have to select how long you want the oven to cook for and then it will turn off automatically when it is done.  If you find you need a few extra minutes, it's very easy to turn it right back on.  To use the convection oven, you do need to preheat the oven first, but that's not a problem.  One feature that was awesome was that when I took my dish out of the oven to stir it, the oven did not start cooking again until I pressed the start button (so the time didn't keep going either).  Most people I know use the timers on their ovens or use a stand alone timer that they can take with them into another room if needed or move to where they will hear it when it goes off.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with this microwave.  It covers the basics and beyond very well!  I don't expect it to do everything--grill, slimfry, microwave, convection.  But, the fact that it microwaves and bakes so well is enough for me!  Many appliances claim to do too much and we expect one appliance to do it all.  I prefer to do grilled cheese on the stove and frying on the stove, so I don't want to do them in this oven and risk having to clean up a mess.

12147896,R39NVX27IOXXJT,464779766,3,19,27,N,It Misses the Point of Being a Multi-Function Appliance,"I am really upset. I just got a MC11H6033 1.1 cu.ft Counter Top Convection Microwave w/SLIM FRY as a gift. I contacted the chat support as I had a few questions, all of which were answered with, No, but only after I was basically told Yes to all three questions and then dared to question the Yes.<br /><br />I asked if there was a timer function, told yes, then told no after I asked the rep to tell me where it was located, and how to set and use it. Who makes a microwave in 2014 that doesn't have a timer?<br /><br />I asked if there was a more extensive food prep guide/recipe book available to use with the unit because the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide literally only lists 1 food item per function. There's 1000s of foods that could be made using things like the Slim Fry function, but no way to know which of the 1-9 settings to use because there's only 9 food items listed in the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide under the Slim Fry entry. There is apparently no app with this information available either. Neither is there a formula for figuring out how to Slim Fry additional foods other than those listed in the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide. This problem persists throughout the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide in that every function other than straight microwave or straight convection cooking does not give enough information to be able to choose the correct function and setting for foods other than those listed. I only found this information out after asking which setting to use to cook Pre-breaded Fried Okra. I was answered, You can use the slim fry option 2 for Pre-breaded frozen Fried Okra. I asked, How and where did you find that information? He replied, I have gathered the information from our internal database. I stated, I don't exactly have access to your internal database, now do I? So, no additional cooking info publicly available. I guess if I want to try to Slim Fry frozen cheese sticks, I'll need to contact Customer Service and ask which setting to use because apparently, in the world of frozen food, Pre-breaded frozen Fried Okra is equal to that of Frozen Prawns [shrimp], Breaded. That's the example food for Slim Fry option 2 as per the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide.<br /><br />I asked if there were sheet pans, cookware, or bakeware available to be purchased from Samsung, or elsewhere, that were known to fit in the unit; specifically sheet pans. Standard size 1/4 (quarter) sheet pans won't fit because the 9.5 x 13 size is determined by the usable flat surface area and not the outside of the pan itself. No standard 9.5 x 13 sheet pan is 9.5 x 13 on the outside dimensions that I am aware of. SO, where would I get pans that fit? Apparently Customer Service, nor Parts, has a clue. Who makes the inside of an appliance, capable of being a convection oven, too small for standard size bakeware? Toaster ovens don't count - but they do at least have after-market sheet pans available out there that fit in them. If I'd wanted to make cookies on pans that small, I'd have expressed interest in a convection toaster oven to make 6 cookies at a time, not a convection microwave oven. It should also be noted the Microwave Oven Owner's Instructions & Cooking Guide makes a big deal out of you Choosing the Proper Cookware. This is covered from pg 22 to pg 25.<br /><br />I was told by Customer Service, initially, that what I was looking for was available, and to contact Parts about those last two questions. I did. I checked online and I called. The girl who answered actually hung up on me after I insisted that Customer Service had referred me and that indeed those parts should be available. After she ended our conversation abruptly, I brought the absence of those parts to the attention of the Customer Service rep I was chatting with.<br /><br />Other than the above, the straight microwave function and straight convection function work well. The drop-down oven style door is a really nice feature. The blue display lighting is pretty.<br /><br />How does a company make a product without giving the consumer, or providing to the consumer at an additional charge, adequate instruction or equipment to use their product? I just don't understand how someone puts out a product with 1000 uses and only reveals 20 of them. Obviously people like me don't test them out or question the developers or designers or engineers before putting a product on the market without adequate instruction or equipment to use their product.<br /><br />Obviously, my logic is lost on Samsung - or it's too complex a logic for someone who works there to have figured out. In any case, with a hefty $249 on sale to $399 full retail price tag; the MC11H6033 1.1 cu.ft Counter Top Convection Microwave with SLIM FRY is definitely not worth the money since you can't use it to it's full potential.<br /><br />Review Update:<br />So, as of Christmas Day, I still hadn't found a commercially available sheet pan that actually fit inside the unit. My mother gave me an old broiler pan that she had for a long gone oversized convection toaster oven.<br /><br />I was using just the convection oven feature on the unit for the first time (I'd only used the Slim Fry feature to that point) to cook a dish for Christmas dinner; all of a sudden it just stopped working. The unit head cut off and there was no display visible. I thought maybe I'd tripped the breaker. I unplugged the unit and checked; I had not tripped the breaker, but I turned it off and back on just to be sure. I plug the unit back in and nothing. I've been found something else to plug into that outlet so that I can make sure the outlet was in fact functioning correctly. It was. I then pulled out the owners manual and proceeded to the troubleshooting section. It recommended unplugging the unit for three seconds and plugging it back in. I unplugged it, and left it unplugged for a solid five minutes. I plugged it back in and still nothing.<br /><br />For a unit this expensive to conk out while using one of the features for the first time, definitely says nothing good about the unit. For the unit to conk out while making Christmas dinner; that was just a headache I didn't need that day. I would dub this a completely unreliable unit.<br /><br />I regret that I never did have the chance to try french fries using the Slim Fry option.",12/4/2014

Within only a few months of owning, the handle broke off, and the front plastic cracked. Of course my husband lost the receipt, so we could not return it, so we've dealt with it with no handle for a year. Now the whole front plastic has broken off and the glass fell out so we can't use it any more. Why would LG continue to make such a poorly constructed product? The plastic is brittle and the construction is bad. I would say this microwave does not even heat food as well as some of my past cheap counter top models.

44119696,R3JZE9CG32BIMC,486381187,4,2,2,N,Mostly pros and a couple of cons...,"I purchased this microwave in October 2008 (2 years and 10 months ago) after a disastrous experience with a GE Spacemaker.  If I could give half-stars, I would give the LG a 4.5 at this point. It was very reasonably priced compared to others with similar features, and reasonably easy to install.  It does a good job overall, has some features that the Spacemaker did not have, but also lacks some nice features that the (much more expensive) Spacemaker had.    Here's what I really like about the LG:  1. Multiple speed exhaust fan with timer.  2. More time/Less time buttons.  3. Soften/Melt/Defrost settings work well.  4. Turntable on/off setting is useful for large or oblong cooking vessels.  5. Popcorn, hot dog settings are very accurate.  6. Hold Warm feature keeps cooked items at a safe temp for up to 90 minutes.  7. It doesn't need the clock set just to use the microwave, (like the Spacemaker did.)  8. It works reliably every time I use it!    Here's what I feel the LG lacks:  1. Doesn't remind you after cooking is finished (the Spacemaker beeped discreetly every 30 seconds for up to an hour).  2. Reheat settings are sometimes a bit too aggressive.  3. Can't adjust the volume of the beeps when setting or finishing cooking (default volume is a bit loud).  4. Aesthetically, the black window on the front is not as attractive as the Spacemaker's white window.  5. Although the EZ-ON button starts and adds 30 second increments, a Quick-Minute button would be useful.  6. The turntable is smaller than it could be (although this has not really presented any problems).  7. The Spacemaker had an automatic nightlight feature, the LG does not (this is a small inconvenience).    At this point in its lifetime, I would recommend this microwave.  If that changes, I'll update this review accordingly.",8/8/2011

Again it was serviced for the handle alone. Just after the 1-year warrantee expired, the handle cracked the 3rd time, this time creating a much bigger fissure on the door so that it now cannot be opened. While the machine still functions, the design of the door is so poor that I would not at all buy another microwave from LG again.

The presets are for things like oatmeal, babyfood, hot dogs, that sort of thing.    The main problem I have with the oven is that the handle just came off.  I looked closely at it and the plastic around the two screws which hold the handle on is melted and cracked.

52140157,RWQ45I8N7CFTX,486381187,3,8,8,N,Good and cheap and it works,"I bought the 1.6 cu ft white one of these. My older and twice as expensive Whirlpool died and I didn't want to spend another 500 bucks on something that I now realize is a disposable item. When these break, almost any repair will cost as much as a new unit so I decided to stop buying top tier on these ovens. This unit was easy to install. It's lighter than my Whirlpool was, so I was able to hoist it onto the mounting plate myself and start the top screws without a problem. I think perhaps those who are complaining about the weight bought the larger model? Who knows. Sometimes it's hard to tell what some folks bought in these Amazon reviews.<br /><br />As others report, the fan is REALLY loud. Wow. And low fan is just as loud. The fan is definitely the down side. I found that the light is bright enough. Cooking is fast. The control panel is very Spartan. Oh, it has all the buttons, but where my old microwave said Pizza and Casserole etc. in the display, this one just has a numeral and you'll have to refer to the book a bit until you get the hang of it. Most of my cooking is just hitting the quick button anyway, so let's be real. I'm glad it doesn't have a lot of features I'll seldom use and that I would have had to pay for. The door looks solid enough to me. I see no problem with keeping it clean that others have reported, but perhaps that's because mine is white? So it's a good basic microwave, as cheap as they come and it works just fine. I consider it a 5-star cheap microwave.<br /><br />Edit added:<br />Well, it has stopped working properly after 6 months. Most annoying is that the interior light will not turn off even though the door switches are working properly. While I liked the Spartan controls, my wife learned to detest that feature. I've decided not to have it repaired under warranty, but to be rid of it and buy a unit with better build quality. I'm dropping it down to 3 stars. It will probably be discontinued soon anyway but hate to leave my former rave review in place without changing it.without changing it.",6/19/2010

For this one, if the recommended cooking time is 3-5 minutes I will have to put it in for about 3:30, where on our old one I could put it in for 2:45.

It was almost new and I was able to remove and install it myself.  Despite a cracked plastic part on the front door (prior owner said this happened within the first month), this microwave lasted about 2 or 3 years before having some erratic heating issues;  at full power, sometimes the food coming out was as cold as when I put it in.  I got around this by selecting 90% cooking power.  This worked for another year or so before eventually having erratic cooking no matter what I did.  Last week the microwave shutdown within the first 10 seconds of heating.  Unplug and plug the unit would reset it, but same issue if I tried cooking.  Later that day, tried cooking again, this time the timer would run but no cooking (and the usual fan noise didn't start either).<br /><br />This $1000 Whirlpool Easy-bake has clearly cooked itself.  A microwave at this price SHOULD be bulletproof.  Clearly it is not.

17239271,RBRQSRDAU9FB0,494668275,3,0,0,N,"Some unique features, falling apart","I bought this because I don't have a double oven in my kitchen and this can serve that purpose.  If you have a double oven, then I think you are better off with a standard high quality microwave.    This is a high speed microwave convection oven; but due to the size of the cavity the conv oven takes longer to heat up.  About 10 minutes to reach 350. Once preheated convection works good.      Does a nice job with frozen pizza, rib roast, chicken, etc. This makes really good toast in 6 minutes, 3 minutes per side, you have to flip the bread. But I don't think it saves any time.  Also, when you use the convection oven, remember it has to cool down to use it again as a microwave. That can take another 10-15 minutes.    Bought mine about 4 yrs ago with a 5yr extended warranty. Within the last month, a piece of plastic trim fell off, door handle cracked, and the touch screen started randomly simulating keypresses.    Repair service came out 3x to get the right parts ordered and repaired, maybe it's fixed.  Will find out.    Cooks well.  The best feature is that this is a variable microwave; unlike most units that simply turn the magnetron on and off to vary the Power %, this one actually reduces the power itself... very cool.  This also combines microwave with convection bake and grill capabilities, and you can control the bake temp as well as the % of microwave to use. For grilling you control the microwave % but not the grill temp, as the grill halogen just stays on the whole time.  That isactually a very nice feature.  On my regular oven, the broiler turns off at 500.    So from that standpoint the unit is pretty smart.    Get this on a firesale if you can... get a long term 5yr + extended warranty, you will use it.    As other's point out, it doesn't have program cooking, can't do a delayed start, can't do multiple programs in sequence, doesn't have a meat thermometer, but it does have a lot of pre-sets.  So, it's an OK unit; I haven't really found anything that competes with it.  Would be interested in hearing feedback on better choices.",3/3/2011

When it works, it is fabulous, unfortunately that just isn't often enough.  We had this microwave for @ 3½ years and if we were lucky, we got 2½ years of use our of it.  Sadly, the sophistication of this appliance seems to be its Achilles heel.  There are so many feature to break and they do!    I could accept the fact that our unit was a lemon, however this was the second unit I purchased...the first died in two days and it was decided that the retailer would just take it back.  Also, a good friend of ours purchased the same model and has had numerous issues of their own...with their door components (LCD panel, etc) replaced multiple times.    We love the microwave, but just can't handle the constant breakdowns and huge delays in repair...typically down for a month due to delays in service calls, all parts having to be ordered, then waiting for tech to come back...and in many cases, waiting for them to order more parts. When the unit is down, not only don't you have a microwave, you don't have an exhaust fan, so there's an impact to all of your cooking!

Tech was onsite for approx 5 min, did little/no testing and decided to order AC Filter board (along with previously broken plastic components from earlier repairs)  12/24/2009 - Tech determined incorrect part (AC filter board) ordered, so placed order for 19 additional parts and left with no further action.  1/7/2010 - Replaced 19 parts - didn't fix original issue (Magnetron not heating/cooling fan not running) and caused a new issue - exhaust fan not functioning - this was a 6 hour service call.  Six additional parts ordered - microwave left in pieces and not re-installed on wall.  1/14/10 - Tech replaced 6 additional parts (3 hr call), (LCD control board, upper front plastic frame, magnetron cooling fan, wiring harnesses).  Issue with exhaust fan was determined to be bad new relay control board (replaced on last call).  Tech installed original board (which had a visible burn mark on it and unit worked.  Tech order new relay control board.  - Unit worked when tech's left, however by the end of the day, the display was flashing and non-functional.   1/20/10 - Control board arrived and installed and the exhaust fan did not work, and issue with the LCD was not resolved.  Re-installed original relay control board and exhaust fan worked, LCD issue still occuring.  1/21/10 - Tech attempted to address issues and after having signifigant problems, escalated to advance support.

We have to take food out right away to stop the beeping, or open the door and let it sit with the light on.  Just a poor design in that way.  Seems to cook normally and looks good.  Still running okay after about 18 months.

Having the WARRANTY is worse than not having one.  The Microwave is not working from just around Christmas.  Early January, it should have been fixed.  The Service company called and told me that the parts are not available, so the next possible touch point is Feb 18th.  So, looking at guaranteed no microwave for about 2 months, and even after that there is uncertainty when it would be fixed.  Had I NOT had the Warranty, I would have just taken a loss and gone ahead an purchased another Microwave of a brand called NOT FRIGIDAIRE.  ===========  - This Microwave lasted less than 6 months  - Of course you think all should be fine because it is under warranty.  - Yes, it is under warranty, BUT:    a) you are given the direct contact of a Service Provider, and you are no longer working with Frigidaire directly.    b) So, the buck is passed from Frigidaire over to a third party Appliance Service company    c) The appliance service company guy came, took a look at the Microwave and said they will need to order parts either from their local supplier, or directly from distributor. This could take up to 10 days  So, now you are left hanging without a  Microwave for 10 days or more. With the time off needed to be away from Office to handle the multiple appliance service company appointments, the Warranty is just not worth it.  Also, called Frigidaire customer service.

43446309,R26567ZHWEL86T,542519500,4,1,1,N,This microwave is a winner.,"I purchased this microwave at Best Buy. From reading the other reviews I guess Whirlpool does have a problem with the way these units are packaged. My LG microwave suddenly stopped working and I am ashamed to say that the majority of my cooking is done in the microwave - TV dinners, oatmeal, popcorn etc. so I wanted to buy and take home my purchase immediately. After shopping at Home Depot, Lowes and Costco I found that none of these retailers kept over the range microwaves in stock. The same proved to be the situation at Best Buy except they had this Whirlpool microwave that had been returned because of shipping damage and was available for immediate sale and for $100.00 off its $249.99 regular price because of a large dent on the left rear that cannot be seen after installation. I had read reviews and intended to buy a Samsung unit but, I did not want to wait 3 days for delivery and for $150.00 I figured it was worth the risk. The installation went well, I found the instructions and templates provided good information on the installation procedure. I was able to install this microwave by myself. The LG unit I was replacing came with the home so I don't know how old it was (other than I bought my home 1-1/2 years ago) and it was considerable heavier than the Whirlpool unit. The door on the Whirlpool unit opens and closes better than the LG unit, it is extremely easy to operate and has been functioning flawlessly for the 2 weeks I've had it installed. I have never been a fan of Whirlpool dating back many years ago to a Whirlpool washing machine I had owned, bad memories last a long time.

We owned the microwave for 1 year and 3 months before the magnetron went out (the manufacturers warranty was for 1 yr and opted NOT to buy the extended warranty).  I understand that modern appliances don't last forever and that some parts may break on a high usage item (handles, knobs, etc).  What I have problem with is when the part that makes it a microwave lasts only one year…on an item I paid approximately $275 for.  When I contacted Whirlpool, they offered to sell me an extended warranty and advised me of the charge for the part and labor to replace it.  Home Depot tried calling Whirlpool Customer Service on my behalf, but hit the same brick wall I did.  I am sure most moderately priced appliances have roughly the same &#34;shelf life&#34;, but I did expect a $275 product to last a bit longer than 15 month.

46709222,R670U3MGCVROB,542519500,3,3,4,N,Track record not great,"First off, I don't know why Amazon is so expensive on this unit. I just bought one today at a big box store at their regular price of $250. I bought the prior model to this one a little less than 4 yrs ago when I bought my new construction house and upgraded to stainless appliances. One day it worked fine, the next it would act like it was working, but the food wouldn't heat up. Microwaves are supposed to last approximately 9 yrs. I am not happy about having to spend another $250 after just barely 4 yrs. Shame on Whirlpool for making disposable appliances nowadays. I will say it is a nice looking microwave, but I agree with other reviews that the fan is useless. No suction at all if you place your hand under the filter. I also don't understand why most microwaves are rated at 1000 watts and every frozen dinner on the planet says it is tested with an 1100 watt unit. ???    On another note regarding Whirlpool in general I have the following to say. I bought all Whirlpool appliances when I bought my house and I will never spend another dime on Whirlpool again. The only reason I bought the Whirlpool microwave replacement is because my house is for sale and I don't want mismatched appliances. When the washer and dryer were delivered and installed the dryer had a noticeable knocking sound that the delivery guys blamed on flat drum rollers. The front load washer has a ridiculous time trying to balance a load during the spin cycle. The refrigerator has more sharp edges that I have cut myself on in the door compartments than you can shake a stick at. It also doesn't cool down a 12 pk of beer in any less than 12 hrs. I tried to cook a ham in the oven and followed the directions based on weight and temperature....cold ham! The dishwasher is ok but I hate the silverware basket. Not big enough for utensils with large handles. Whirlpool needs to wake up and build quality products that are functional and last. Never again.

29341302,R1UPRJLG0V1Z65,542519500,4,5,6,N,So far so good - install a bit tricky,"Bought this to replace a builder-grade off-brand unit that came with the house. In performance and style, this Whirlpool microwave is absolutely superior. A few notes:<br /><br />- Heats faster and more evenly than I'm used to. Depth is 17 inches, which is one inch larger than my old microwave. Thus, I'm able to use my large square plates in this one.<br /><br />- Install was a bit tricky. I installed in a slot previously occupied by a microwave, so I did not have to cut a vent hole or locate studs. I did have to remove the old mounting plate, which was shorter. This unit came with a cardboard template to locate the bottom line of the mounting plate on the wall. This wall template worked fine - I simply drew the line, then held up the metal plate, and drilled into the studs in the appropriate holes.<br /><br />The top template was a different matter. Whirlpool provides a paper template to affix to the underside of your cabinets to locate the holes to drill for the cabinet mount. If you have a recess under your cabinets, as I do, you will need to trim the template to get it to fit. I did this, and drilled through the template holes. They were about a half inch off. I threw the template away and remeasured, and drilled 9 1/2 from the back wall (not 10 as specified in the installation instructions). These holes worked.<br /><br />The power cord also has to go through the cabinet above. The instructions say to bore a 1.5-inch hole. I did this with a spade bit (enlarging a ~.75 inch hole from the old microwave). Seems a bit large, could probably have gotten away with a 1 inch hole.<br /><br />I have the microwave wall-vented. Installing the flap with sheet metal screws on the microwave and placing into my pre-existing vent hole was easy. I can't speak to the ease of the ceiling vent mount.<br /><br />- There are presets for popcorn, potator, and pizza. Of these, I've only used the pizza setting to reheat a small slice. Took 1 minute 40 seconds on a lower setting,but heated it a bit too hot. Would probably be fine for a large slice.<br /><br />Other than that, it looks and works great.",11/13/2013

I tend to hate overly complex controls.  I want power and simple controls.  This microwave meets my needs in this regard.  This microwave has lots of power.<br /><br />Now the bad.  The install.  This is my second microwave install.  My first being a retrofit of an over the range fan.<br /><br />My first install, and noticing the hardware of my current broken microwave.  The units are mounted by a rear wall bracket that holds the bottom part of the microwave.  And the top of the microwave is held by a couple of suspension bolts fixed to the cabinet.  The USUAL location of these bolts are the two front corners of the microwave.<br /><br />The rear bracket is usually the same size/shape as the rear of the microwave.  This makes it fairly easy to just place the bracket on the rear wall and push up until the bracket touches the cabinet.  No measurement really necessary.  This Microwave has a small bar hanger.  So you'll need to be very accurate with a measuring tape to figure out where the bottom of the Microwave will sit against the wall.<br /><br />I tend to not trust myself in this regard.  So I taped the bracket to the bottom of the microwave.  Held the microwave up against the wall, and had a helper draw a marking line with a pencil.<br /><br />The second negative.  Usually the suspension bolts are at the front corners of the microwave.  In mounting position, my current defective microwave has boltsin the corners.  I could have taken the other microwave from my other house and I suspect the holes are in the same position.<br /><br />On this microwave, one bolt is about 3 inches in from the edge (which is slightly offset).  The second bolt is about 7 inches in so it is offset quite a bit.  Both holes did not line up with my current microwave mounting holes.  So to mount this microwave I had to drill new holes in my cabinet.<br /><br />So take this into consideration.  I bought my unit as a floor model return.  I suspect it was returned for this very reason.<br /><br />Otherwise I've been happy with this purchase so far.",11/4/2012
51268693,R1YZHE6E5J8WBB,544821753,1,0,0,N,Worked great - until I got the dreaded SE error code,"I purchased this in 2010 and it worked great. Then a couple of weeks ago I came into the kitchen and saw the SE error code. I wasn't able to set the clock so I unplugged it and started researching what the error code meant. As you have probably read in other reviews, this is a common Samsung problem. The steam from cooking on the stove underneath the microwave damages the cooking sensor which causes the entire oven to malfunction. And please understand that I haven't used my stove top for cooking on a regular basis!<br /><br />After a couple of hours, I plugged it in to see what happened and was able to set the clock and use it. I was thrilled but cautious. Which was good because within 10 minutes I heard the microwave beep and start cooking. I shut it off and watched it and within 15 seconds, I saw &#34;Baked Potato&#34; on the screen and it started up again. So now it's unplugged and will be replaced.<br /><br />Samsung says it's out of the warranty period but will send a technician to fix it for more than it will cost me to purchase a new unit. I did get five years out of it so I'm chalking it up to lessons learned - no more Samsung microwaves. When they have this many ovens with the same problem, you would think the company would make things write. To be fair, I have always owned Samsung televisions and been very happy with them. Maybe the microwave business isn't for them?",6/26/2015

29083622,R20P9L37S796TG,544821753,1,0,0,N,Great when it works,"This may or may not be a solution for you but it worked for me.<br />My SMH8165ST was purchased in January of 2012. In March of 2014 it started having the SE errors and similar to others on this site, would start on its own, night light would go off and on on its own, beep every 15 minutes, etc.<br />I tried all of the YouTube and other suggestions with removing the circuit board, cleaning all the connections. Originally this worked for two weeks, and then the problems restarted. Kept on repeating the process for the next 2 ½ months with the time interval getting shorter and shorter between cleanings.<br />The last time I left the power on when reinstalling the panel and the system worked fine. Oops, forgot to reinstall the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />Reinstalled the panel with the mounting bracket, again with live power and the SE error came on instantly.<br />Repeated the process three times, no errors without the circuit board mounting bracket; SE errors with the Circuit board mounting bracket.<br />With a large magnifying glass, I discovered a very, very small scratch on the ribbon cable between the circuit board and the control panel. This scratch lines up with a very sharp edge on the circuit board mounting bracket and it seemed that through vibration and general use; the ribbon cable was starting the have a direct contact between the embedded wires in the ribbon cable and the sharp edge of the mounting bracket, more than likely causing the strange SE errors.<br />I covered the sharp edge on the mounting bracket with electrician’s tape, as well as the ribbon cable where it bent around the mounting bracket projection.<br />Then while reinstalling the panel with live power, I tried twisting the panel, hitting it against the edge of the microwave, jiggling all the wires and all sorts of moves to see if the SE error would show up. No errors showed up.<br />The microwave has been working perfectly for two months now. It my case it is most likely that the manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.e manufacturing process was at fault for installing the ribbon cable tight against a sharp edge of the circuit board mounting bracket.<br />I would give this microwave 4 stars if it wasn't for the poor quality control during manufacturing.",7/28/2014

51367435,R2FXF4JSMMEPY8,544821753,2,0,0,N,Terrible user interface compared to GE; dim light and worthless timer.,"I wanted to replace our GE SpaceMaker over-the-range 30 microwave and found this model that matched well.  (We actually have the black version, but it is otherwise identical.)  The Samsung obviously shares the same basic design as the GE with a redesigned front panel.  I knew and trusted the Samsung brand from our personal electronics (such as several smartphones), so picked one of these up on sale at a local retailer.  Unfortunately, what I got was a bare-bones minimal redesign with major flaws.  It's like they took the basic GE design, made it super cheap, and replaced the panel with a terrible non-intuitive redesign.<br /><br />Installation was easy - I was even able to use the original rear mounting plate as the Samsung was, indeed, a twin of the GE series.  This microwave fit perfectly into our 30 wide opening with very minimal gaps on each side.  I had to drill new holes through the cabinet above, however, as the top was slightly different.  The height is 16 for the main cabinet, 16 5/8 to the very bottom of the light box underneath (not shown in the picture, but it's there).  I plugged it in and quickly realized that this sure isn't the same quality as the GE was.<br /><br />The first and most annoying thing is the user interface on the front panel.  The buttons are hard to interpret, and things that are easy on the GE are now impossible or very confusing.  Heating a beverage is common, right?  No beverage button on this unit - you need to discover the button to press is COOK, and then wait for the slowly scrolling text to confirm you are correct and need to press 1 next.<br /><br />What about canned vegetables?  There's a VEGGIES button, so this should be easy.  Not so!  Press the button, and across scrolls: SELECT ... (pause) ... 1 FOR ... (pause) ... FRESH ... (pause again) ... VEGGIES ... (um, I know it's vegetables, I just pressed the button!) ... 2 FOR ... (yet ANOTHER pause) ... FROZEN ... (darn, guess it must be 3) ... VEGGIES ... clear ... SELECT ... (oh no! where can frozen veggies be?!) ... etc.  At least the SELECT doesn't scroll when it appears, only when it's scrolling away.  But the worst part is seeing the VEGGIES on the display, alone, as I wait, knowing full well I pressed the veggies button.<br /><br />And I still have trouble figuring out which button is for the fan and which is for the light.  Making it worse is that there is one button for the light (HI/LO/OFF) and 2 buttons for the fan (ON/OFF and 4 speed).  Actually, there is another button each for some obscure settings we never use.  Sure, there are some tiny dark grey letters showing which set of button is which, but those are only visible up close in bright light.<br /><br />Gone are the easy 1-button 1 to 6 minute quick start buttons.  Now it takes 4 button presses to do the same thing, although at least there is still a button to add 30 seconds.  I could go on and on about the poor interface, but I think you get the idea.<br /><br />Next major issue: the stovetop light is way dimmer than the GE was.  Even though there are 2 places in the design for bulbs, and my GE had 2 halogen bulbs, this one has a SINGLE incandescent bulb - not bright at ALL.  This is huge, as we use our stovetop frequently and now it is always poorly lit.<br /><br />And a another biggie: when the timer finishes, it gives 4 short, quiet beeps, and stops.  No repeat, nothing more.  So unless you are right by it, it is pretty much worthless.  We can now only use our oven timer - so no more dual timers when we are cooking different things.  I can't even count how many things have overcooked or been ruined because of the lame timer.<br /><br />The look is also unattractive.  The lightbox hangs down below the lower front plastic panel, ensuring everyone knows how tacky this microwave is.  Even the display is an ugly old-fashioned blue 14-segment per digit 7-digit display.  Most calculators have better!  Actually, I kind of like the blue.  Everything else in my kitchen is amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.  It frequently makes weird grinding-like noises from the bottom right (I think it is a fan or the microwave element) - if I tap it there it usually diminishes or goes away for a while.<br /><br />Finally, the front glass broke once when we were opening the door a couple of months after getting it.  Samsung did send out a repairman within 2 weeks and repaired it under warranty and it hasn't happened again in the many months since.<br /><br />Is there anything I like about this microwave?  Well, it works.  It has a turntable.  It has sensor cooking.  And it has dual grease-filters on either side of the bottom with a powerful exhaust fan (that has 4 levels when not using the microwave, 2 when in use).  It also has an easy-to-clean all-white interior.  And it was less expensive (on sale) than the similar GE units - but rightly so.<br /><br />PROS<br />It works.<br />Sensor cooking.<br />Dual grease filters.<br />Easily fits space replacing similar GE models.<br /><br />CONS<br />Horrible user interface.<br />Poor single-bulb incandescent stovetop lighting.<br />Loud, obnoxious noises.<br />Cheap looking.<br />Worthless kitchen timer.s amber, so it creates a nice contrast.<br /><br />Furthermore, it is noisy.

A while later, the house filled with smoke. Smoke and  flames were shooting out of the top vent of the microwave. She said there was so much smoke she could not even see in the kitchen.  She called 911, the fire dept was dispatched, and she exited our home. By the time they arrived the fire had burned out on its own, and the damage was contained to the internals of the microwave. The fire crew removed the microwave from my home, and inspected the home to insure that the microwave was indeed the cause of the fire. Thankfully there was no damage to our home other than the microwave itself, and a strong odor of smoke and burnt plastic (I'm sure it will take weeks to get rid of the smell).<br /><br />I contacted Samsung, to report what happened and am awaiting a response from the Executive Customer Relations dept. do to the nature of the incident.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what I want from them, more than anything to create awareness.

After four or five months of light duty use, we returned home to find the door standing open and the light on inside.  There is apparently a spring in the door that holds the two latches in the closed position.  That spring either came off its mount or broke, because the latches no longer hold the door closed.  I asked Samsung to tell me how to open up the door so I could replace the spring.  They said no, I'd have to pay them for a service call.  I asked if they would tell me how to remove the door so I could take it to a local repair shop.  No, again.  Keep in mind that the spring apparently failed while the unit was just sitting there, not in use.

13932786,R3BHSP5EBOV2X3,544821753,4,0,1,N,1 1/2 years old and still surprised,My so-called top of the line GE Profile microwave burned out and had a bad tube after only 3 years so I needed a microwave that would match all my appliances and didn't want to make the mistake of spending a fortune on a microwave again since nothing seems to last anymore.  I really liked the Samsung looks and the price compared to the other big brands was enticing but I read tons of negative reviews and held off on buying it.  A few weeks later I see it on sale from its already great price and bought it $230.  It sticks out about an inch more beyond my cabinets than the ge did but I think this is intentional as the exhaust vent blows out of the top toward the front of the unit.  This actually provides better coverage when cooking on the stove top as well since everything rises right up into the vent hood.  It's been a year and a half and it still works great.  It's just as powerful as the ge was so either it's under rated or the ge was over rated in wattage.  For under 300 bucks you can't go wrong with this microwave.  The stainless doesn't mark up with smudges as easy as my other appliances and it has just as many features as the more expensive ones.  It's controls are lot easier to use than the touch screen was on my ge.  Fyi don't get a touch screen appliance!!  I like the 4 fan speeds.  My only complaint is when the kitchen timer goes off it just beeps once and it's easy to miss it.  Other than that I'm really surprised at how great this microwave has turned out and though I haven't had to deal with customer service personally I've heard they're very easy to deal with which is more than I can say for ge.

Why? Because I cook a lot of steamed food (rice, pasta, vegetables) and they do not. I'm sure the heat and steam from the range top has, as others have noted, damaged the circuit board.

Since then, the fan and light have completely stopped working. The oven itself still works, but it makes me super uncomfortable how quiet it is as it heats, does it need the fan? Does it need to vent? I don't know. But I know after all the other comments I'm not reading on Amazon, that I'm not comfortable finding out.<br /><br />When I called LG, they asked if it was plugged in. I explained that the microwave worked, but not the fan or the lightbulb. She said it was probably my outlet. Not very helpful. When I called a repairman, he said fixing it would cost $200.

As far as I'm concerned LG does not care about their customers and instead of telling me I need to purchase that part, which might not even be the problem, they should have just sent me the part free of charge.  Home Depot is going to work with me on this since I purchased appliance from them.  I was not aware there had been a fire issue and will now be watching and careful.

Actually, I was surprised that the customer service rep didn't express any concern whatsoever about us having a fire in our kitchen, no big deal I guess!<br />And, I have to add that it is vented correctly, I double checked that.  Installed above the stove and room vented.<br />We purchased ours May 2013, it's now March 2014 so it had better still be under warranty.  To be honest, I'm now very uneasy at the thought of getting another one of these, I'd never trust it again.  Thats something I'll be talking to them about after the service tech comes out.<br /><br />Note Added 16/3/14:  I also reviewed microwave on Lowes.com last week but it was not published. Presumably they delete any negative reviews.  Will never trust that site again, after all, it was the positive reviews on that site that made me buy the thing in the first place.<br /><br />Update 17/3/14:  Service Tech came out and said it was the fan cover that caught fire.  The second one he's seen in this area in the past 2 weeks.  Luckily?? we were able to stop the flames before it melted anything but the fan cover itself.  So they are just replacing the fan cover.  Assured me it is a different model though.  They also told me that it happened because we were cooking popcorn (in a microwave popcorn popper) and it was too close to the ceiling.  But, we've used the exact same bowl in 3 different brands of microwaves over the past 10 years without a problem, so I just don't get it.<br />To my dismay, they didn't care about the burn marks on the ceiling of the microwave either.  Sure, it's not a large area, but it's still really noticeable.  Just told me I should be able to get it off with bleach, (which didn't work) or to go out and buy myself some touch up paint.<br />So there you go, up to you if you want to risk buying this model.  I'm not happy at having brown burn marks on the ceiling of a less than 1 year old microwave but their attitude is that it's my problem, not theirs.",3/11/2014

Some changes necessary for mounting, fortunately, the exhaust duct was in the same position as the older unit and installation took about 1 hour. Love the larger cavity size and rotating table. Helps to warm foods more evenly when using microwave. Works wonderfully as microwave and as convection oven. Saves us energy by allowing us to bake many foods without having to use our stove's larger gas oven and it works quickly. Only two &#34;observations&#34; we have are: 1. Touch Pad is very difficult to see in normal light. Attractive design, but near impossible to read as the gray typeface on black background is horrible choice. Not a big change for GE to make, surprised that engineering has not yet ordered such an important and easy revision. This may well be a safety and/or frustrating issue for some persons. See the labels I ended up making for the touch pad. (See Photo) 2. The volume of the beeper (at loudest) is barely audible.

Update May 2016 - First time we used the convection heater at 400 degrees, after about 5 minutes, the oven died - was as if a fuse had blown - Ge service arrived the following day to diagnose the problem, a blown thermostat.

23745233,RZV2OHYHB78PT,618770050,3,2,3,N,Be careful on installation. Some SS Steel parts magnetic.,"I just installed this item. Be careful with the lag screws provided. They are tin like and do strip out no matter what and cannot be loosened or tightened once the head strips. They require a special flat nose phillips head but that did not help. Buy some quality mounting screws as $ 500.00+ is not enough for GE to include those, and I hope the rest of the unit is not as cheap as the mounting screws. Pollute the planet and make a extra trip to the hardware store. Second, I was leveling the microwave and son of a gun, the magnet on my level stuck to the inside of the unit, which is supposed to be stainless steel. I would still prefer whatever this stuff is to the plastic interior that comes with non-convection. The templates were perfect and put all the screws in the correct locations. You need to order the charcoal filter if you are using the recirculate rather than outside vented feature. To recirculate, you must unscrew 3 screws on top rear and rotate the fan housing 90 degrees before you install the unit. You also need to remove 2 screws on the upper front trim and slide in the filter then replace the trim. My 15 year old did both. You need to butt the top of the unit to the shelf above, or insert trim pieces around the top. If you don't, and let it hang even 1/2 inch, the unit can rise up if hit and fall off the shallow rear flanges that hold it to the back wall bracket and fall onto the new matching GE range. Our cabinets had a wierd from the 1960's lip on one side (I like old school stuff) and I needed to add the trim to prevent falling. The unit powered on and worked once we finished. Will update after a few months of use. I am a licensed electrical and general contractor, so I hope this helps in getting it ready to install. Took my son and I about an hour. The unit looks great in the kitchen. After months of research, it was between this and the Sharp, but this had more power and capacity, and there was not a Sharp in any showroom for QC comparison.

I was appalled to be told that they never install the filters, even if purchased from that store (bought mine on Amazon for $30 cheaper than the chain!). Was told I have to take the front panel off!!  IF the directions are followed carefully, it's very simple. It is designed to tilt, not stand straight inside the vent opening, as one would think. I tell YOU all this to say, laugh at the installation guys, get a screwdriver, and tilt the filter in, and pat yourself on the back. Who needs them anyway? Oh, yeah...to lift and drill and screw the thing in. It's heavy! Now, as for performance, more to come later!<br /><br />One last thing, all the reading I did on this led me to believe the vent was a powered door that opened, and that is a part that often breaks on OTR microwaves.

51720674,R1IXI53QMLLDTN,618770050,3,38,44,N,Oven:  Good.  Installation: Problematic.,"I had an older GE microwave above my range that died after about 8 years. When looking for a replacement I decided to go for another similar GE in order to swap it out easily, figuring it would use similar hardware. That was my first mistake.<br /><br />There's a steel plate used to mount the oven on the wall plus three big screws that go in from the cabinet on top. Not only is the plate different (requiring removal of old & installation of the new), not only are the anchor points in different places (requiring new holes), but they're placed just marginally off the old anchor points. Meaning that the integrity of the wood where you need to drill is compromised from the old screw holes. It required me to install a whole new shelf in the upper cabinet as well as trying my best to fill the old stud holes with wood filler and hoping it would be strong enough when I re-drilled.<br /><br />Here's the kicker... the installation hardware comes with butterfly screws as well as two thick wood screws for mounting to the wall studs. Unfortunately, those two wood screws are made of very cheap & weak metal. I pre-drilled guide holes as per the instructions, but when it came to screwing the screws in- the heads twisted right off on both of them (and I was extra careful with the second one after the first one broke).  The screws were already 3/4 of the way in, leaving me with no way to remove them and blocking the ability to try again in the same spot (a spot required for proper installation).  The oven isn't light, the installation requires heavy duty hardware, why ship the microwave with such crappy screws?<br /><br />Lessons:<br /><br />Buy your own mounting hardware.<br />When it comes to buying a replacement appliance, there's no value in nepotism.",6/18/2012

The problem I encountered was that after owning it for about a year and a half, it suddenly stopped working.  I'd set the time and hit start, the light inside would come on, the clock would count down, but neither the turntable would turn nor would the microwave actually start cooking.<br />I drove it to a Sharp certified technician, and about $65 later, it worked fine.  At least, for another year or so.  Repeated the process, paid another $65, and then it worked fine. This time, for another year.  Thanks to the economy, my Sharp certified technician lost his business, and now I had to drive it over an hour away if I wanted it fixed.<br />I brought it to a Sears service center, where they fixed it for about $50, and they said there was a problem with some kind of safety latch with the door.  This time, it lasted about 6 months.  I agree with other users, that every microwave on the market has some kind of issue.  It's time to accept the fact that we want these machines to do more than they could 15 years ago, and either the craftsmanship isn't there, or our appliances simply can't handle the demands anymore.

It comes with a grill rack, and you can cook meat on it.  When you use the grill function, you can put metal into the microwave . . . but just be careful that you take out the metal once you use it as a microwave proper. The gill function works fine, but doesn't make your food quite as crispy and nice as a regular toaster oven does.<br /><br />*  The crispy plate is also perfect for doing pizzas, and the students who have been using it to cook frozen pizzas have said that they are evenly cooked.<br /><br />* The 1,000 watts make this pretty powerful.  It's good at evenly cooking food, and doesn't leave those cold places in frozen dinners like cheaper microwaves do.<br /><br />*  There are ten power levels and a plus 30 seconds button, so you can easily add more time to your cooking time.<br /><br />* A standard variety of pre-set buttons make this good for doing basics such as popcorn, veggies, and potatoes.<br /><br />* The exterior has a scratch-resistant coating, and the stainless steel facing doesn't pick up smudges and fingerprints like stainless steel often does.<br /><br />The measurements on the 1.1 cubic foot microwave are: 11-11/16 H by 20-3/8 W by 15-13/16 D in inches.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really nice microwave.

Maybe even a toaster oven if you wanna reheat those chicken mcnuggets. There's also one more minor issue. The rotating glass plate is raised a bit too high around the edges than i'm used to.

53035876,RX1ZUVGBH3HKC,692404913,5,814,848,Y,THE WORLD'S MOST MISUNDERSTOOD KITCHEN APPLIANCE?,"I've written quite a few product reviews in the past, but never have I seen so much debate and misinformation about what would seem to be a simple kitchen appliance! A lot of the reviews I have read here are either mistaken in their details or are trying to compare apples to oranges. Samsung (or whoever the Samsung dealer on here is) has only added to the confusion, unfortunately.<br /><br />First, a few points to set the record straight. The appliance is NOT covered in stainless steel. There may be a bit of it in the trim, but it seems like whoever wrote the description hasn't actually sen one in person. Most of the outside has a black, textured metal finish, which does seem to blend in quite nicely with my own black and stainless steel kitchen appliances. It may not blend in with a kitchen that is all stainless and has no black in it though.<br /><br />There is a bare minimum of plastic in the construction, which is limited to the trim, &#34;open button&#34; and part of the door latch. I have not had any problem keeping either the highly polished front door clean nor the outside of the appliance. In fact, the texture of the black sheet metal on most of its outside surface actually prevents it from becoming a fingerprint magnet.<br /><br />Another misconception comes from the grill rack that fits inside. Some people have mentioned that it is only to be used in the grill mode, which is not true. The rack can be used in the combination grill/microwave mode just fine and your microwave will NOT burst into flames. From the manual, page 11: &#34;Grill Rack, to be placed on the turntable. The metal rack can be used in grill and combination cooking&#34;. It will even &#34;work&#34; in the microwave-only setting, although it won't contribute to the cooking process at all. In fact, the main feature of this appliance is the ability to both microwave AND grill at the same time, and you can't utilize the grill to any effect without the rack in place.<br /><br />This brings me to the main point of my review. Those who are most critical of this appliance are simply comparing it to a microwave. This is an apples vs oranges type of logic as the addition of the grilling element really makes this an unfair comparison. Is it heavier than most stand-alone microwaves? Of course it is, because it has an entirely separate heating element, electronics and carries the additional weight of a ceramic enamel interior. This is really two appliances in one that work together seamlessly to greatly enhance the texture and heat distribution of foods such as pasta, pizza, crusts, etc. The additional heating element also makes the appliance larger than stand-alone microwaves, which is entirely understandable to me. This also explains the slightly lower wattage rating than some heavy-duty microwaves. If used with the grill though, it seems to cook items just as fast as a microwave with a higher wattage rating.<br /><br />Adding to the weight is a metal exterior that uses a heavier gauge of sheet metal than the vast majority of stand-alone microwaves on the market. The reason for this is pretty simple. To keep people from burning themselves when coming into contact with the appliance. Without the heavy-duty (which is necessarily heavy) inside and outside finishes the device has, it would eventually lead to someone getting accidentally burned. For those who wonder why it doesn't have more capacity or more wattage, the reasons all boil down to safety. You can only add so much shielding to keep the size (and cost) of such an appliance practical. I think that Samsung engineers did a pretty good job at balancing safety, size and materials to keep this at a reasonable cost for a device that offers so much more than a simple microwave does.<br /><br />In regards to cost, I have seen the price of this product fluctuate wildly over the past few weeks. At one point I believe it was $179 (shipping included). Then it went up to $230 (shipping NOT included). Today, it is down to $199.99 with free shipping. I have no idea what the MSRP of the unit actually is, but for the quality of construction it has and the features it carries, it seems like at bargain to me.<br /><br />For me personally, this product is just the right size for the foods I cook and offers a lot of flexibility as to how I can cook things. The polished surface makes it by far the nicest looking appliance in my kitchen, ever. It reminds me a lot of my Samsung Galaxy S4 cellphone, actually. All in all, I couldn't be happier with my purchase and I would recommend it to anyone. If you have no interest in the grilling feature you probably wouldn't want to buy this though, because it is definitely more expensive than a stand-alone microwave. If you are only going to use it for microwaving it is overkill. I'd never go back to a regular microwave after having used this though. I am too spoiled with this product's cooking ability at this point. In any event, I think that it deserves more praise than it seems to be getting here.

We're 30 miles from Salt Lake City in Park City, a major resort town with a winter population of 100,000 people, so it's not like we're in the sticks.<br /><br />Nine days after I called, the repair service showed up.  He repaired one part, then stated that the magnetron was damaged, and that he would need to take the microwave to his shop for more diagnosis and repair.  Then he would have to order parts, then he would bring it back when his route brought him to our area again - so, two more weeks at least (assuming Samsung has the parts in stock).  On the way out of the door he banged the microwave into our door frame, putting a major dent in it.<br /><br />I called Samsung customer service again, and stated that I thought three weeks or more was too long to repair the unit.  They blamed the tech for not bringing all the parts he might need (what, a whole microwave?) but refused to offer to even expedite parts to the repair shop to cut a week off the time, let alone discuss any kind of replacement.<br /><br />With a family of 5, we use a microwave multiple times a day.  Samsung should have better quality in the first place.  When they have a failure, they need to have a better repair and support system in place, and if they can't do better than 3 weeks or more to repair an appliance that gets used daily, that's not good enough for me.  Do you need a failure like this right before you have family coming for the holidays? Would you be happy to spend weeks with a giant empty space in your kitchen where your microwave (and oven hood) was?<br /><br />We don't. No more Samsung appliances for us.  And good luck to Samsung in taking on Whirlpool, Bosch, Asko, Panasonic, etc. - the other appliances we have in our house which have worked great with daily use for years.  I'm off to the store for another brand of microwave, look for this one on eBay - still under warranty!<br /><br />By the way, we tried to post a version of this review (edited in accordance with Samsung.com's review guidelines) on Samsung.com, where Samsung supposedly allows customers to rate their products (and this microwave currently has a 4 star review).  We received a notice today that they would not post our review--no rationale, only that it did not meet their standards. BUYER BEWARE!",1/16/2014

15092789,R2O40D2F3YVB0O,784164614,4,3,3,N,"So far, so good, for the price","We installed this above an Electrolux dual-fuel oven, for which it provides venting and downward-facing LED lights in addition to its primary microwave functions. It was fairly inexpensive and looks good in the kitchen.  Observations in no particular order:<br /><br />1. The sensor cooking on this is much better than on our old Sharp countertop unit, which overcooked everything.  I had thought at the time that it would be nice if there was a way to calibrate the sensor.  While the Samsung doesn't give you calibration options, it does let you say what you are cooking, and apparently adjusts its response to the sensor accordingly.  I have found that it works pretty well to always tell it I'm reheating pasta!<br /><br />2. A general-use kitchen timer is provided.  Of course most microwaves do, so that's not unusual, but this one is smarter than some.  It is able to function independently of the cooking timer.  For example, if you are timing something for 30 minutes, then decide partway through you want to heat a cup of water for one minute, it will correctly keep track of the 30 minute timer in the background and display it again after it's done with the water.<br /><br />3. Minor niggle: the oven vent is supposed to come on whenever it detects heat rising from below, but ours seems to always need to be turned on manually.<br /><br />4. This is where the Samsung loses a review star.  The Eco Mode feature is poorly conceived.  When you press the button, the panel lights go out and standby power consumption is reduced.  So far, so good.  But then as as soon as you use the microwave again, or even just open the door, or use the oven light or vent options, it leaves eco mode; the display comes back on and STAYS on.  It really should remember eco as a user preference rather than as a temporary mode.  I also suspect this ties in to the problems some customers have had with the control panel failing.  If we were allowed to set a persistent eco mode, it's likely that the front panel would be mostly-off except when in actual operation, and as a result it might not burn out.  We have made it a habit to push the eco button after each use.<br /><br />In sum, it fits with our kitchen decor and cooks well, and we hope we will be able to make it last a long time by remembering the eco button as often as possible.",10/12/2013

I have always liked Samsung.<br /><br />Bought and installed this microwave in January of 2012. It just died two days ago. Totally dead... no functionality whatsoever. No lights, no keypad, nothing but dull, silent, insolent non-function. It isn't my circuit, as my oven (also Samsung) shares the outlet and is working fine.<br /><br />I called Samsung, and since it is just out of warranty, the service call would be $125 just to look at it + parts and labor. On top of that, the first call would be the diagnosis, and the technician would not have the parts. They would have to reschedule for that.<br /><br />Since I have a toddler in the house, not having a microwave is out of the question.

13427325,R24MYKY0TSYHR9,784164614,1,12,16,N,Stay away from Samsung,"I spent several thousand dollars on Samsung appliances as part of a kitchen remodel in Oct11.  In May I noticed that when I opened the door of the microwave it appeared to have a short (a bright light flashed then went out).  It still heated but as I thought it might be a fire hazard I contacted Samsung.  They set me up with a service repair company that had a poor rating on Angie's list.  A guy came out, dismantled it and said a key part needed to be replaced (he noted 'switches' on the service order dated May 15th).  He said it would take 3-5 days so he came back a week later, without the part, saying he just need to tighten some wires.  It worked for a few weeks, then started to heat only intermittently.  Called the service company again, and a guy came out and jiggled the door, saying there was a problem with the switches, but that they didn't need to be replaced.  It worked again for a few weeks, where I had to keep jiggling the door, and finally stopped heating altogether.  Now, knowing that there was a problem with the switches, I expected the guy to arrive with the needed part.  He came but again, no part, saying he just wanted to confirm it was the switches and that the part had already been ordered.  After not hearing anything for a few weeks, I called back and was told that 'Sharp parts were backordered'.  When I told her it was a Samsung, she didn't look up my order but just said she would look into it and call me back.  After not hearing anything again, I called back and she said the same thing (Sharp is back-ordered, correction it's Samsung)and said she would call me back.  Again didn't hear back so called Samsung.  The escalation department reviewed the situation and I was put in for an exchange because the process had gone on so long.  She said I would get a call from someone who would review options with me (when I asked what the options would be she didn't know--why is that?).  Instead, I got a call from Samsung a week later saying that the servicecompany had miraculously received the part and they wanted to schedule a service call.  I told her I had been put in for an exchange and she insisted that I again deal with this disreputable service company.  I refused, and since I didn't have the Transaction # she said she would call me back today.  She didn't call this morning when she said she would so I called Samsung.  Just got off the phone with Samsung, who refuses to replace my microwave.  It just seems to be a game of stringing customers along with vague and misleading promises.  The only 2 service companies they have for this area have F ratings on Angie's list.<br />I had a similar situation occur with my 1 month old stove back in December, which broke on Xmas Eve.  After 3 months of fighting with Samsung Best Buy finally felt sorry for me and gave me a new stove.<br />After spending thousands of dollars on Samsung appliances I expected more from Samsung.<br />I would stay away from Samsung or if you do purchase an appliance from them, get an independent warranty.

Well, we had a Kenmore microwave in the same exact spot for 9 years and it never once tripped the breaker. They have no explanation as to why it doesn't heat. They haven't fixed it, I'm worried the electrical system is faulty, and therefore a fire hazard and Samsung refuses to replace it.  The problems occur sporadically and as a repairman hasn't actually seen it malfunction they don't believe me. Do not buy this OR ANY SAMSUNG PRODUCT!!<br />The total lack of concern for their customer is shocking. My husband and I spent an hour and a half on the phone with some lackey from customer service named Landry H. and all he did was spend the entire time telling us he couldn't help us unless we agreed to a THIRD service call to see if they could catch it not working.

Her story:  - - -  I was unpacking it and I reached inside to remove the shipping cardboard.  Then I see some cardboard on the side and I took my fingernail and lifted it, and tore it out. Then I see a bunch of holes and a hole at the top where the cardboard was. Uh-oh! What did I just do? It is as thin as the cardboard on a school notebook, the thin kind, but it is silver in the light.  It looks like cardboard when you open the door. But how can that be, that I could take my fingernail and rip it out? And this is supposed to last for how long?    I called Whirlpool customer service, and the rep said she will send me the part. Then her manager said they don't have any parts so there is nothing they can do because I broke it. What? I ripped it with my fingernails and you are telling me this would have lasted how long anyhow?    I politely asked to speak with the supervisor. That took 15 minutes and he was so arrogant. But mam, you broke it. IT LOOKED LIKE cardboard and I ripped it with my fingernail. There is nothing we can do for you.    I can't take it back because the local store said that Whirlpool won't take it back. I will run the microwave until it dies and NOT BUY ANOTHER THING FROM WHIRLPOOL. I will call the attorney general and make a complaint against them.    I will never buy this again, or any appliance from Kitchenaid, Whirlpool, or Maytag! (And we currently have a refrigerator and dishwasher from them.)  - - -    I wish we would have bought this through Amazon.  At least then we would have a better chance to return it.    We got this one because we are replacing a Samsung microwave oven which was fantastic.  I would say it was at least 15 years old.  It had the controls along the top which was a terrific approach to making a compact, usable microwave with a small horizontal footprint and large interior.  Samsung no longer makes a similar design.    The only microwave ovens we've been able to find with a numeric keypad on the top are commercial versions which run over $800.  We hoped this one would be acceptable, but it's not.  The controls on the bottom are even worse than the side from a usability point of view.  We find ourselves bending over to see the labels on the buttons.  We really miss the numeric keypad, also.  With your head higher than the microwave, it makes so much sense to present the controls closer to your eyes.    This was a big mistake.",11/14/2014

Needs a recall, but Whirlpool does not care.","This microwave was selected during a KB HOME build for our new home over 2 years ago (Summer 2010).  The microwave indicated that it was manufactured in April 2010.  Low and behold the microwave would start shutting down by itself when I hit start beginning about June 2012.  A few days ago it just stopped working completely.  No pop, no fizzle, no crackle - it just wouldn't heat up anything.  Whirlpool dispatched a 3rd-party repair person and he stated that the magnetron was bad (or dead?).  He was fairly certain it was a recall item.  The repair person estimated that, absent a recall, it would cost $450 to fix. The service appointment itself was $89.  The following day, the repair service left a voice-mail stating that it was not a recall item, but that I should verify it with Whirlpool .<br /><br />I contacted Whirlpool (1-800-253-1301) and the customer service rep stated that it wasn't their problem once the standard 12-month warranty had elapsed.  The rep said there was no recall for the magnetron.  I escalated the matter to a supervisor.  All the supervisor did was reiterate that Whirlpool wasn't going to do anything past the 12-months.  The supervisor then offered to sell me one of four new microwaves at a VIP rate.  Of course the rate was not VIP at all once you added the deliver ($70) and the installation ($45) charges (so for being screwed over, I was a VIP?).  It goes without saying that I didn't take her up on the offer(s).<br /><br />Needless to say, I was very upset and immediately Google'd the model number in the hope of finding out more info on the problem and perhaps locating a cheaper replacement for the microwave.  And that, my friends, is how I ended up here on Amazon and saw that 29 other reviewers before me also had issues with this particular microwave.  I got a certified lemon.<br /><br />What are my options at this point?  A class action lawsuit?  A complaint to the state Attorney General's office? I don't know. What I do know is that Whirlpool is aware of the problem and could not care less.

12734207,R3JT1Q06HSNG6O,921964554,1,6,6,N,Third one in 2 months and still don't have a good one...waiting for parts,"What I like about the Whirlpool/Kitchen Aid microwaves is they offer models with Accuwave cooking.  When you cook at 50% power, it cooks at 50% power rather than cycling on and off at 100% power, for 50% of the time.  This makes a massive difference on how things cook.  We previously had a GH5184XPS with Accuwave that lasted 4 years before it stopped cooking.  It was starting to not look so nice from normal use, so I decided to go with a new one instead of repairing the old one.      After the new microwave was installed, I tried a cup of water in it.  When I started it, it sounded like an arc welder, and when I looked at the plastic panel on the right side where the magnetron is, it looked like an arc torch flame.  I quickly turned it off so it wouldn't burn the place down.  They took it back and gave me another.  The very night we got it, we were making popcorn in the special Microwave Popcorn bowl, which we had used for years with our other microwaves.  Within a minute, we got an F7 - Call For Service code.  They offered to exchange it for a new one, but didn't have another, but told me they could sell me the new 5184, and updated model of our old one.  I noticed that the new one had a broiler, slightly different menus, $50 cheaper, and we had good luck with our previous 5184.  However, after it was installed, the cook said, this doesn't cook right.  I checked it out.  The updated 5184 no longer has Accuwave.  That isn't how it was represented, so I gave them their $50 back and had them order another one of these from the factory.  That went along for 3 days before we noticed that part way through the cooking time, the magnetron noise would stop, the fan speed up, the light got brighter, and the food stopped cooking.  Since the chicken was still pink, I added 2 minutes at full power, and immediately received an F7 code.  The problem actually started when it stopped cooking during the previous operation.  You don't get the F7 until you try to start it again,and the magnetron doesn't start.  We couldn't trust it with chicken.  We avoided certain foods and alternated between manual and automatic cycles to get around the F7 codes.  As time progressed, we could do less and less.  Now, you can't even trust it to finish a bowl of oatmeal.      That was enough for me.  There is no possibility of buying a good one from the factory, so there is no point in getting another new one.  Thus, I decided I would use warranty service to see if they can put in good parts that WILL work.  The dealer-recommended warranty repair source wouldn't take the job when he learned which model it was.  Whirlpool got another company to come the following morning.  They put a large bowl of water in the microwave to test it, and could find nothing wrong.  They said their manual doesn't even list an F7 code.  There is nothing easier on a microwave than a large bowl of water.  I went on the internet and printed off one of a myriad of postings about F7 for this microwave model, with detail instructions on how to troubleshoot.  Then I put real food in the microwave and showed them how easy it is to get an F7.  Included in the troubleshooting instructions were comments from the techs that service these every day who state that they always go through the procedure to eliminate any other causes, but it always ends up being the expensive microprocessor board.  The on-site techs did not follow the checklist, and called the factory.  The factory told them they will send them a switch to try.  (I was hoping it would be the thermal switch, but the techs indicated it was not.)  The on-site techs reminded the factory that the problem starts mid-cycle.  The factory came back with, as it gets hotter, the switch contacts may be increasing resistance, causing the problem.  I could repeat the F7 at will.  They did not check the switch for high resistance nor follow the factory procedure to troubleshoot the F7 error.  Next Wednesday, the switch is scheduled to be delivered, and the techs will be returning to put it in.  The service company also had little confidence in the factory's recommendation, but they have to do what the factory says.  Perhaps the fist service company has gone through this before and may be why they wouldn't take the job for this model.      I've been through 3 of this model, and 4 installs, since April 5 2011, and I don't have a good microwave yet.  They've eaten up more of my time than the microwave is worth.  Now it's my turn.  I will make it my personal mission to require them to keep sending technicians to my house to fix this model until it works as advertised, on real food, or supply me with a model of equal to or greater value, that works as advertised, for free, and with a new warranty.",6/22/2011

I called up Mabe Canada customer support and after describing the problem and faxing in my receipt, they shipped a replacement microwave straight to my door within 3 business days.  I wish there was an alternative to this microwave, but I'm stuck with it for now, and I have to admit the customer service was fantastic.  Hopefully my replacement will hold up.",7/19/2011
53057553,R37RMUXZRALWPX,943347999,2,2,3,N,The good and the bad,"[[VIDEOID:mo1LOHJ4VRRGAJT]]The good: My brand new, out of the box spacesaver is great looking, it is cabinet depth so it doesn't stick out, it fits perfectly under a cabinet (with the kit) and, when you can get the door open, it works really well.   I just completely redid my kitchen and it looks marvelous.      The bad:  the door doesn't open.   Seriously doesn't open. OK, I'm exaggerating.  If you really, really try, you can eventually get the door open.   From day one it didn't open.  See the video demo of my trying to open the door.      The better:  My wonderful local appliance dealer who sold it to me is not going to try to fix it.  They are sending me a new one and taking this one back. There are some benefits to paying a bit more and buying local.        I'll update this review when I get the new one.    I'm really hoping I get a good one like a subset of the microwaves all of you have.    However, you should not have to wish to be a subset when you are paying over $250 for a microwave.  They should all be good, quality microwaves.  There are so few under cabinet, cabinet depth, models available, we are sort of stuck with the GE Spacesaver.    ____________________    July 23, 2011    Update to my review on this microwave.   My appliance dealer send me a new one and it works just fine.   I've only had it about a month, so I don't know how it will last, but as of right now, it is functioning perfectly.",6/9/2011

35653914,R20EH1OW11MTS7,943347999,5,7,8,N,Surprisingly Versatile Little Microwave...,"As a vertically-challenged individual, I was looking forward to getting a countertop microwave when we remodelled our kitchen.  However, I was not looking forward to giving up the multiple functions offered by my larger, over-the-stove microwave.  Additionally, I did not want to give up my useable counter space which I would have to do with the standard 18 inch or more deep countertop microwaves.  I also wanted enough space left on the counter so that, if necessary, when removing something from the microwave, I could sit the container on the counter immediately in front of the microwave.  I had a small 24 inch wide by 14 inch deep nook available between my refrigerator and the corner appliance garage, but was certain I would not find a suitable microwave to fit.  Since we were not replacing cabinets, I had to work with the available spaces.<br /><br />To my surprise, the GE Profile Spacemaker II was the exact size of the nook!  Although there were many negative reviews of the product, I decided to take a chance on this microwave and purchased one at Best Buy.  Through an abundance of caution, I also purchased an additional 4 year warranty so that if I experience any of the problems others have encountered, I will be able to have the Spacemaker II repaired or replaced.  As the extended warranty was only a little more than a service call would cost, I felt it was worth the expenditure.<br /><br />So far, I am very pleased with the GE Profile Spacemaker II microwave.  My spouse and I do not cook meals in our microwave, but do reheat beverages; cook frozen vegetables and veggie burgers; and, occasionally, defrost meat.  The Spacemaker performs these functions admirably!  Although it takes about 30% more time to heat/cook things than my 1100 watt microwave, this has not been a problem.  Further, I like this model better for defrosting as it does not start cooking the meat like the more powerful models do.  The control panel buttons are very responsive.  I have cracked other microwave's button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.<br /><br />In the past, I have allowed bread to raise inside my microwave.  I found this allowed me to leave the bowl or pan uncovered as there is no air flow inside the microwave, and the temperature remains consistent.  The Spacemaker's interior is large enough for me to continue using the microwave in which to raise bread.<br /><br />Because I keep this microwave on my counter, I keep a plastic glass of water in it to prevent accidentally starting it empty and possibly ruining the magnatron.<br /><br />Further, I would caution those who are looking for a compact microwave for an elderly individual who may be confused by having to choose among multiple function buttons.  The GE Profile Spacemaker II has a control panel that can be confusing as it has 29 separate buttons from which to choose.  Thus, it might not be the best choice for individuals.<br /><br />For me, the GE Profile Spacemaker II is the ideal microwave and I am giving it a five-star rating.  If things change, I will update my review accordingly.s button surfaces because of the difficulty in getting them to respond to my touch.  I do not foresee this occuring with the Spacemaker II.

17998888,R36921V3SM3QEV,981162112,1,0,0,N,GE Should Be Sued For Selling This Piece Of Junk,"UPDATE, DECEMBER 2015: I posted this review in January. The microwave stopped working altogether in June 2015. If you find this model anywhere online I advise you DO NOT BUY IT....<br /><br />Full disclosure - I usually make my purchases from Amazon but I had a coupon for 15% off any item at PC Richards (a local store) and was fooled into buying this when it was recommended to me by a salesman. I've owned it for just over 2 years now. Most problems started immediately. I will never buy another GE microwave for this reason, and I'm considering never buying any GE product - anything that takes electricity to run must be made much better for safety reasons, and this is one of the worse electronic appliances I've ever purchased.<br /><br />PROS: none that I know of. No wonder it's discontinued.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />&#62; Very soon after the warranty ended we started smelling burnt plastic whenever it was used for any length of time, at any power level. The smell lingers and gets into your food.<br /><br />&#62; When cooking anything, a baked potato for example, the moisture from the food gets trapped inside the oven an pours out when you open the door. The walls, floor, and ceiling of the microwave are dripping wet and must be dried after each use unless you want to end up with a muggy mungy moldy mess after a few weeks. And no, the vent is not blocked on the outside. On the inside, maybe, but that would be a defect the consumer cannot see or fix.<br /><br />&#62; Door open button is very flimsy.<br /><br />&#62; Light stays on when you close the door (when you're done) if you are not careful. You must make sure door closes completely - even if it looks closed it might not be and if the lights are on in the kitchen you might not notice the interior light of the microwave is still on - this can make it over heat (I came back hours later and the inside of the oven was very warm) and may blow out the bulb, which normally lasts the lifetime of the oven.<br /><br />&#62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom. This means venting can be difficult if you have something sitting next to it on the left side. See my photo.<br /><br />&#62; All buttons are hard to push, which is not good for those with disability or arthritis.<br /><br />&#62; The clock timer (the one used when not cooking) is tricky to stop - you must read the manual to figure it out because you can't use common sense for this one; manual says you must press timer button and hold for at least 3 seconds to stop this timer.<br /><br />&#62; If you make a mistake when using the cooking timer you can easily add more time to cooking than you planned. For example, I pressed 14 minutes but wanted to change it to 12, so I tried to clear it and thought I did, but when the 12 minutes of cooking time was done it started again on its own for another 14 minutes. There was nothing to warn me this would happen and I could find nothing in the manual that explains it.<br /><br />&#62; No minute button, only 30 second increments.<br /><br />&#62; Turntable moves out of place very easily, like when you place an item on it or remove something from inside the microwave. The groves that hold it in place are shallow so this allows it to move out of place with just a small nudge. Very annoying.<br /><br />&#62; Emails to GE were never answered.62; Vents are on the left side, not the top or bottom.

All this material used to construct something that is just going to clog up the landfill.<br /><br />Here's our story.  Back in April of this year (2014) our old microwave died. We needed a replacement right away because that's how our household rolls.  I eat popcorn, we microwave veggies.... So, hub and I rushed over to HomeDepot to get a replacement. This GE microwave looked nice. We bought it. We also, thankfully, purchased an insurance policy.<br /><br />Well, 2 weeks ago in May this General Electric microwave died. No electrical response at all. Took it back to HD and they replaced it with another.<br /><br />We assumed it was a fluke. That we just got a bad one. A lemon. NOPE. The second microwave died last night. Same symptoms. No warning. Just died.<br /><br />We are returning this General Electric microwave today. HomeDepot will give us another. However, we are also going to buy another microwave because we know this new GE piece of junk might not last out the week. With another microwave in the house we at least won't have to rush out to acquire another one.<br /><br />Don't buy GE.

53094097,R1TQUKEMMCII23,981162112,1,34,39,N,Utter piece of junk,"I bought this GE microwave yesterday -- but not from Amazon, from Best Buy (only because I needed it right away). I unpacked the box and set it up. It would not work at all -- the display continually says Door (despite multiple clearing steps, resets, unplug/plug in, etc.). This display error message is not even addressed in the manual. I spent 30 minutes of my first day of ownership on the phone with GE support. The answer from them was obvious -- sorry, the door safety switch must not work properly. They gave all the usual excuses, sorry-sorry-sorry, please arrange for us to service it or repack it and drive it back to the store. Nice job GE -- an American name product and customer service at its finest, and you wonder why people buy alternative Asian name products. Best Buy should stop stocking GE products if this is GE's idea of quality control. Don't they check that products work when switched on before final packaging? I should not have to drive all the way back to the store. GE is wasting my time.<br /><br />Even more interesting -- I gave a negative one-star review of the microwave on the GE customer review section -- and their verification department that controls what is said on their website about their products, rejected my commentary. They have, however, allowed 14 reviews ranging from 3 to 5 stars. Here is the text of their rejection email to me:<br /><br />We appreciate you taking the time to write a review on JES0736SPSS; however, your review did not meet the guidelines for posting on our site.<br />We encourage you to revisit our guidelines and resubmit your review on JES0736SPSS<br /><br />I then read the GE guidelines, and NOTHING in my submission contravened the commentary guidelines -- it just happens to be a one star review from a very unhappy customer. GE does not like criticism. This experience has further reaching effects -- I am also looking at buying a new high end kitchen refrigerator -- GE was on my list, but no longer.",5/10/2013

The next issue I have is the cardboard piece that is screwed on the inside of the unit. (I really think this is a hazard, not a good idea, and not hygienic if food splatters on it. Next cons were how cheap the turntable holder is and how much extra time it takes to microwave foods. (Frozen Stauffers TV dinner took 9 minutes to cook!) Likewise, if you like to cook microwave popcorn I suggest you use the mini bags with this one...larger bags had too many kernels left or burned if I tried to get most of the kernels cooked.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Very quiet when operating.<br />Perfect size for my 6x8 sq ft galley  style kitchen.<br />Very sleek and the stainless steel accents are beautiful.<br />Has an interior light.<br />Loud alarm to warn you when cooking is complete.<br />It's quite heavy even though it is a compact size. So it won't fly across the counter if you press a button too hard.<br />Lots of preset functions and an easy to understand owner's manual.<br /><br />I thought GE was a great appliance maker...remembering my mother's GE appliances lasting 20+ years!

Expect longer heating times than a larger microwave oven. If you are an impatient person you may want to pass on this model.    The Hot Water presets work fine for reheating coffee.

Excellent value.    My wife and I looked at every small (-1 cubic ft) microwave at all prices before choosing this one. We have a very small kitchen in our condo and counter space is at a premium. We've had this unit for 8 months and it has performed flawlessly with daily moderate use. We use it mostly for baked potatoes, leftovers, popcorn, defrosting, etc, so we haven't subjected it to heavy use. Although it's only 700 watts, it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time (2 medium potatoes in 9 minutes). The black/stainless steel casing and classic styling appealled to us also. Our dinner plates fit on the turntable with just a little room to spare.    At this point, I don't think we could be more satisfied with our purchase ($69.95 at Lowes), especially since we considered models 3X the price. Our previous microwave was a space-hogging Montgomery Ward monster we got as a wedding present 25 years ago (thank Gods it finally died) We'll see how this diminutive new GE holds up.
