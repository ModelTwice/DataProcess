39673693,R1RQQHGWZY6NJK,106521272,5,0,0,N,These never leave our baby's side!,"These pacifiers have proven to be lifesavers. We have multiples, and once your baby loves them you'll be buying multiples too! We have used these since leaving the hospital, and therefore avoided baby waking up in the middle of the night due to losing her pacifier. They stay in because the stuffed animal helps them stay close to their mouth instead of falling out as soon as they stop sucking. As they get older, the stuffed animal serves as a comfort toy, full of texture and appendages to pull. Sometimes baby sucks and chews on everything but the pacifier! They also are easy to wash. We wash the pacifier in the sink, keeping the plush out of the water for quick cleans. Then, when a deep clean is needed (after all that chewing) we wash the whole thing in a delicate laundry bag in the washing machine with her baby clothes. This is why I recommend more than one, so you can wash one and have a back up for baby. The elephant was great due to the big ears, she loves to pull on those. We constantly have other parents asking about this pacifier....once you have one you'll be a believer.",4/14/2013

When I would be riding in the front seat I would have to reach my arm into the back seat and hold the pacifier in his mouth almost the whole ride by the time we reached our destination I couldn't feel my arm. Now I just lay one of these on his chest and even if he falls asleep it doesn't fall out of his mouth so if he starts trying to suck again it's still right there for him.",3/21/2013

If you've ever used this pacifier though, you know that it has a tendency to fall out....a lot. The little toy can be set on the child's stomach and provides enough stability that it keeps the pacifier in his mouth.

It sits on her chest well, making it easier for her to recover after spitting it out accidentally and making it less likely to fall on the floor.  The elephant gives me something to easily grab from the drivers seat while reaching back as she cries on her way home from daycare.  Suprisingly, it also helped in her development of learning how to reach/grab and becoming more coordinated.  She's now four months old and still loves this Soothie pacifier, although she also uses MAM pacifiers in the house.  I held out for a couple months, but just gave in and purchased another WubbaNub last week.<br /><br />It would be wonderful if the pacifier could be separated from the animal for easier cleaning, but this doesn't deter me from recommending it to all of my friends.",2/8/2013

Keeps binky in the crib and is easy to find.,"Not only are these incredibly cute, but it is fantastic for those times when binky pops out of the mouth in the middle of the night and baby wakes up and needs to find it. I spent months getting up in the middle of the night, multiple times, to retrieve a binky that either rolled out of the crib or baby couldn't find it. This one is easy to find in the crib and it won't fall out of the crib!! This is essential to parents' sanity and sleep!! We get tons of comments on this because it's so cute and unusual. I've even washed this in the washing machine (air dry) and it didn't fall apart. After probably a year of solid use, the binky part did eventually come off of the elephant, but I re-attached it with a safety pin and it's still being used. The biggest downfall of this binky is that other kids really want to steal it! :-) I would absolutely recommend this product for you and for every baby shower you ever attend!

I thought at first that the idea of this item was really great. A combination of a pacifier and stuffed animal seems like it would be so soothing! My son showed no interest in this item and even when I tried to introduce it as he grew he still wasn't impressed. He is 1 year old now and has never used this item. So I guess it depends on the child if they like it or not, but this is not why I am giving it two stars. I am giving it two stars (stars are for the good idea) because this item it almost impossible to clean. You cannot sterilize the pacifier and when you wash the stuffed animal you need to let it air dry (you can't put it in the dryer because of the pacifier). I wish it was made in a way that would allow you to detach the pacifier more easily so that you can clean the stuffed animal and pacifier separately.",9/9/2012

We have not tried other types of pacifiers so I can't compare them, but my son took to the Wabbanub right away (we introduced it around 6 weeks).  He can hold on to the animal part when it's in his mouth and usually manuver it back in when it falls out.  He primarily uses it in the car and at daycare.  My one complaint is about cleaning it. I have been hand washing the pacifier part with dish soap and really hot water. The pacifier does not detach from the animal so I'm not sure how I'll clean that part when it gets really grimy.

Well, now that I have them, I cannot imagine life with out them!  Not only do they use my son's favorite brand of pacifier, the Soothie, which most hospitals use, but the lightweight attached toy is of great benefit by helping the pacifier stay in place!  When my son accidentally spits out the pacifier, instead of it bouncing off of him to who-knows-where, it stays in practically the same spot, just below his chin, provided he does not knock the stuffed animal out of the way.  I like this system better than any pacifier clips I've used because with the clips, he'll spit out the pacifier, and although it is still attached to him, it will likely drop to his side and far from his mouth.  With the Wubbanubs, the pacifier stays nearby more often than not, and any parent who has ever used a pacifier knows that that is a great thing!!!  These are definitely worth the money, and be sure to get at least one for the diaper bag and one for home!",3/14/2009

We like to keep one handy wherever we go: at home in the nursery or play area, in the car, in the diaper bag, and for daycare. If your baby uses Soothie pacifiers, this is an excellent addition  to your baby gear! Also a plus, Wubbanub  makes the red dog and yellow duck plush toys attached to a lovie-type blankie so when your ready to be rid of the pacifier, you can substitute the blankie and not take away your baby's favorite cuddle toys. I recommend this product to all new parents.",12/25/2008
25091802,RFNX1LX6DLUP9,110124739,5,0,0,N,Best pacifier EVER!!,My baby's nurse recommended this pacifier when he was in the NICU.  He is 14 months and still loves to carry it around.  I was worried because the soothie pacifier can't be detached but these have lasted 14 months and I throw them in the washer/drier and they come out like new.  They claim to be for up to age 3-6 months but they are actually quite durable.  Soothie makes pacifiers for older kids but not in a Wubbanub.      We get these for gifts for anyone we know is having a baby.  Because they are attached and weighted down (like a beanie baby) they are great for young babies who can't hold a pacifier by themselves.  It'll save you from having to constantly have to put the pacifier back in their mouth.    I love this product!!,10/21/2008

You might be thinking that if one's child is old enough to demand the soothie by name and color she is probably too old to be using this thing?  I say I would think the same thing.  Don't do what I did- break your little one's addition in the 9-12 month timeframe, becuase if you leave it until 20 months (where we are now) it's probably become your child's 'lovey' by now and they are well addicted.

29928875,R1OB43NB7DH7RM,137289931,5,0,1,N,MARVELOUS  DEVICE,"This is an excellent product. It may look a little expensive for a thermometer, but it's a good price if you consider the peace of mind the can bring to your life, especially at night when you have a sick infant or toddler having fever episodes due to a virus or other reason. When after struggling to give them some medicine and help to go to sleep, They finally feel better and go to sleep, the last thing you want to do is to wake them up by trying to check on theirs temperature. When my 1 year old daughter was sick with flu like symptons, including fever, it was a big relief for me and my wife knowing that we could just get close to her and check her temperature without touching her body; that made a world of a difference. We compared this thermometer we many others we have and find it to be as accurate as any good conventional thermometer could be.

She had about six of the 0-6M ones (all &#34;flat&#34; ones but in different colors) and then when she turned 6 months old, I bought her the 6-18M ones. This is the only design with handle where the water cannot come out completely when I wash the pacifiers. The flat ones are fine. I hand wash, machine wash, and sterilize all the things my baby puts in her mouth all the time, so I didn't think it would be a big problem.

I had planned on not using a pacifier with my daughter due to my firstborn's heavy attachment to his. However, she started wanting to nurse 24/7 a couple weeks after she was born, so I finally broke down and bought her a paci. It became clear very quickly that she wanted nothing to do with one. I tried multiple pacifiers and none of them were even remotely accepted by her. I was pretty beside myself about it and did a search to see what the most breast-like pacifier was and was led to this one. I placed my order right away, and as soon as it was delivered I opened it up, boiled it, and presented it to my daughter. She didn't care for it until she got a little upset later on, but then she took it right away! She definitely knows the difference between the pacifier and the breast, but she has accepted the pacifier as an &#34;okay&#34; substitute until boob becomes more convenient.

It fits very nicely, with no gaps, but I was a little put off by the material.  We have a firm crib mattress from Da Vinci at home, and this mattress seemed much more firm.  It's also covered in plastic, not fabric; although it's nice not to need a waterproof mattress pad, it winds up being very noisy if your baby moves, rustling the sheet against the plastic.  I would have preferred a fabric cover, and either buying a waterproof pad myself if I was using the mattress a lot, or just forgoing it and risking ruining the mattress, since it's fairly inexpensive and we were only using it for a short time.<br /><br />I know these aren't huge issues, but the bottom line is that my baby did not sleep well on it, and since we were in the same room, neither did we.  She adjusted quickly to the new surroundings and napped just fine in her usual Rock 'n Play, so I don't think it was just the fact that we were traveling.  She fidgeted the entire night (which kept us up all night with the rustling on the plastic!) and woke up much more frequently.  It was, however, an improvement over the 'mattress' that comes with the Pack 'n Play, and for the price, I am glad that we purchased it.

They are the same great quality you expect when you buy them in twos for twice the price in the grocery or department store. So next time your kid throws his pacifier into the mysterious bermuda triangle of pacifier extinction... no sweat... just grab another one. Our son loves to throw everything (including pacifiers) into the trash when we have our backs turned :)",4/1/2014

Especially considering we did not have a &#34;backup&#34; of the exact type.<br /><br />We ordered these hoping they would be similar to the ones he was use to, but as you likely already know, sometimes little ones can be particular about what they like/dislike. While these were delivered quickly and were exactly as listed, our son will not take these. I would highly recommend these to anyone who is already familiar with NUK pacifiers. If you're not sure if your little one will like these, try purchasing a 2-pack prior to shelling out the money for all 8.<br /><br />And if he or she likes them, then order these in case your little one also plays the &#34;throw the pacifier&#34; game.",3/7/2014

(And I spent a lot of money on various brands). They are durable and last a long time..and the ring make is convenient to hold on your finger or use with a pacifier clip. The only thing is that they are sometimes hard to clean. When you use soap and water, it gets inside the nipple. In order to get it out, you have to cup your hand with water while squeezing the nipple. This gets some water inside to wash the soap out. After that, I always throw them in the sanitizer.

It's the third monitor I purchased, and by far the best.<br /><br />The reason I'm only giving 2 stars is because of Motorola's customer service problems. In the last couple months, the power button has stopped working consistently. I sent an email to support@motorolamonitors.com (the address listed on their site), and it bounced back. I tried again a few days later. Again, it bounced back. I called the customer support line. Nobody ever answered.<br /><br />Leaving aside the question of my broken power button, I find it unsettling that a baby monitor manufacturer doesn't have a functional customer support infrastructure. This is not a mom & pop shop, after all, but a giant multinational corporation. And they don't have a working email address?<br /><br />The first monitor I owned was the Angel Care baby sound monitor -- their customer service was the complete opposite. Personal, prompt, helpful.

13161265,r2nnc5wbxfpvpl,175568661,4,3,3,N,"Great, with some hiccups","After looking for the perfect baby monitor, we settled on the MBP33.  14 months later, we still like it, with some caveats:<br /><br />1.  Having a video feed, in addition to the audio, is wonderful.  This monitor does an adequate job of displaying a good angle of the room and is pretty clear even in the near dark.  In my opinion, the video doesn't have to be high definition, but simply good enough to give an idea of what your kid is doing.  This monitor does the job, and does it well.<br /><br />2. After about 11 months of use, the monitor would not take a charge.  Playing around with it, I determined that the wall charger was fine, but the battery would not recharge, or continue to work even when plugged in.  Even though we may have been out of warranty (we received the monitor as a gift well before the twins arrived), I called Motorola and they agreed to replace the monitor for free.  Much more than I expected from customer service.  So although it failed, Motorola was responsive and took care of the problem.  Since then, we haven't had any problems.<br /><br />3. The user interface isn't perfect.  For example, we have twins and purchased an extra camera for a second room.  While we love the ability to add extra cameras, and the possibility of setting the monitor to automatically cycle through the cameras, for some reason you cannot change the video feed while the volume or brightness control is on the display.  And there is a huge lag in the time it takes for the volume control to clear the screen after you hit the button.  Often, we'll hear one kid crying, pick up the monitor and turn up the sound, and then have to wait several seconds for that to clear before changing to a different video feed.  While this may seem like user error, or a small inconvenience, I'll be the first to admit that we aren't always thinking clearly at 2 a.m., which also happens to be the time when I have the least patience for the volume control to clear so I can change feeds.  This isn't a deal breaker, but it keeps me from giving it five stars.<br /><br />4.  It has additional features, like the ability to play music and speak through a microphone to the camera.  I've never used these other than to make my wife jump when she is putting away the kids' laundry.  It doesn't detract from the product, but seems unnecessary to me.<br /><br />Overall, this seems like the best monitor for the price.

43966337,RS1Z2JO99728I,179662085,5,4,4,N,Great follow-up to Nuk soft orthodontic pacifiers,"I wasn't going to let my baby have pacifiers, maybe because where I'm from they're called &#34;dummies&#34;. Anyway, all that changed 3 days after she was born and was screaming non-stop. My mother-in-law sat me down and said &#34;now I know you don't want to use pacifiers but babies need to suck and if you don't want to breastfeed non-stop they'll help... plus they use them in the neo-natal unit at Stanford Hospital so how bad can they be?&#34;<br /><br />At my wit's end and in tears I begged her to get some for me. She returned with 3 kinds (not these, because they're not for newborns). My daughter liked the soft Nuk ones the best, but when she turned 6 months old they were too small for her so I took myself off to the store to find the same, but larger. They don't exist, so flexing my super scientific muscle I endeavored to pick the one that was closest. These were them. The colored bit is hard plastic to keep the shape, but that piece is completely covered in soft silicone. It took my daughter about a day to get used to them and the work wonders for calming her.<br /><br />You set so many rules for yourself as a parent, always with the best of intentions, but you have to be ready to flex and this is one I'm glad we broke. Nap times and I-hate-my-carseat-and-just-want-to-scream times are much easier with these.  We're about to wean her off them, but am so glad we found them when our other ones got too small.",9/19/2013

I was initially worried giving my son a pacifier would disrupt breastfeeding, but it did not.  He was first given these while in the NICU and they really soothed him and helped keep him happy both while in the hospital and when coming home. Unfortunately for me, when my son turned 2 or 3 months old, he refused to take this pacifier and thus was without something to soothe himself.  I found that at around 5 months when he starting teething he preferred the regular Avent (non-Soothie) pacifier, but then a few weeks, he rejected that, too!  So perhaps the issue was more my son simply did not want to take a pacifier.  I never had a problem with the quality or safety of the Soothies, though, and I definitely recommend trying them, especially when your baby is a newborn.",7/3/2013

I was constantly picking up and having to wash his other pacifiers because whenever they fell out they were gone.

19256369,R2TEJGQXPZ2CZH,21803708,3,1,2,N,"Excellent concept, but cheaply made...","I really love the concept of this toy/pacifier. And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.<br /><br />However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:<br />- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.<br />- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.<br />- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!<br /><br />Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby...",3/23/2013

It is machine washable and as soon as you take it out, it does not really need to be dried as it is dried already and is ready to be used.<br />I thought it was a bigger giraffe and was disappointed at first to see it so tiny, but I believe it is the appropriate size for an infant not to choke on. It is a pricey ($13-$14 ea.). Wish it was half price, and wish I could replace pacifiers on the stuffed animal, but can not, since it is sewed with stitches to the giraffe.<br /><br />BabyHaven is really professional and nice. When I received other regular Soothie pacifiers in damaged boxes, they offered to send me replacements for free. Hoping to receive them soon by mail.<br />----------------------------------------<br />Edited April 8, 2013:<br />I now have an Amazon Prime Membership with my Amazon Mom membership, I receive everything in 2 days and can return items with no hassle. Back when I bought the Wubbanub and Avent Soothie Pacifiers from BabyHaven, I thought they proposed to send me free pacifiers to replace the damaged packages I received but they did not and wanted me to pay for the return shipping rate. They said since product is not damage it is my responsibility. They tucked 6 Avent soothie pacifiers and 3 wubbanub pacifiers in one small bubbly envelop!!! The Avent Soothie's package was ruined but they did not care.<br />They were not so professional what so ever.<br /><br />We are treated better when we get the Prime Membership as we deal with Amazon directly versus with the seller. Packaging is better, as they send in a boxes even small ones versus in an envelop that gets ur package damaged from shipping.<br /><br />Would still recommend the product though.

I prefer these because they are symmetrical so when you're fumbling around in the dark half asleep you can get them the pacifier without having to determine which side is up.

Once the baby learns how to put their pacifier in their mouths, it's easy for them to do and since they glow in the dark, it's easy to find in the crib at night. I'm not a fan of the clear ones because they're hard for him to find. To the reviewer who said the pacifiers make her baby drool, that's like saying a specific diaper makes your baby poop.

He seems to like the less molded shape of the Mam nipple and has been a happy camper since. I'm not so impressed with the glow in the dark because they seem to not glow after an hour or two, even though I set them on the windowsill during the day - however we've found that if he has a couple pacifiers in his crib, he'll put them in himself now if he loses the one he fell asleep with - very nice way to offset the issue of the pacifier falling out and it needing to be replaced (usually by you!) at 4am.

Unfortunately, we didn't introduce them until 18 months and switching so late in the game was not going to happen. I wish I had known about them earlier.  The price is a little crazy but if it saves you the orthodontic costs later in life I guess it is not so expensive after all :)<br /><br />My almost 2-year old has had a pacifier addiction since birth. Since around 12 months she has only been using one for sleep.  She prefers the Soothies to the exclusion of all others. Since she had begun teething, she was chewing on them and biting small holes in the newborn Soothies that she preferred (0-3 month) and we had to replace them almost every day.  So, we started buying the stiffer 3+ month Soothies.<br /><br />At her 18-month pedi appointment he noted that her teeth were developing crookedly.  I had noticed this myself so was not surprised with the report.  He suggested switching to the orthodontic kind. We bought binky after binky hoping she would give one a chance. The clear silicone ones were not going to happen.  She would look at them, yell at me, and throw them on the floor.<br /><br />Fast forward a few days:  I saw these online, the price was steep but it was the opaque type of material sort of similar to the Soothie so I bought two sizes 0-6 months and the 6+ months (she prefers the size and texture of the newborn pacis).  She put it in her mouth for a few seconds and spit it out.  Then she refused to take it again.<br /><br />We now give her the 0-3 month Soothies again(luckily she stopped biting through them after a couple of weeks of intense teething).  They are much less stiff than the 3+ month Soothies and her teeth are looking better but not perfect.  I do think the stiffness was a big part of the problem.<br /><br />Although I am sure that other parents would disagree, taking away the binky is not an option in my mind due to her level of attachment.  So, I put it into perspective:  there are way worse things than crooked teeth.  As the pedi said, this is crooked teeth, not cancer.  Enough said.n option in my mind due to her level of attachment.

I wish the part that sticks out of the babies mouth was smaller because when you are trying to take pictures it feels like it's covering the babies entire face!!

Instead the plastic of the entire pacifier is sturdier.  In the babies mouth, the pacifier does not bend and catch on the babies gums.  Because of this, the pacifier will fall out of the babies mouth when they are sound asleep.  This is actually a good thing because it teaches baby that they need to self-soothe at night time.  As I mentioned earlier, the shape and texture are different - very similar to a thumb.  Since this is so similar to the thumb, your baby might choose to self soothe by sucking on their thumb.  While this can be good because they will stop using the pacifier on their own, it can be a problem if they continue to suck their thumb months later.",1/2/2015

The material seems very durable and it's easy to clean.  We think he may like the shape because it's closer to simulating a nipple or a pinky finger.<br /><br />The shape is a bit different from the 3 other brands we have, but I actually find I like it better.  It doesn't lay flush to the baby's mouth, which allows saliva to run or dry.  With the other pacifiers that curve with baby's face, the saliva just pools around his mouth and caused a little bit of skin irritation.  Our baby may have sensitive skin, but it seems better with this soothie.  One disadvantage is that it pops out easily and has nothing to keep it in place - though I guess we could get around this by fastening it to him, but we were paranoid about having anything hanging around his neck.<br /><br />I guess every baby is different, but our little boy gives the Phillips AVENT soothie for 0-3 months 5 stars.",5/3/2014

I keep them in the nursery, in my nightstand drawer, in my diaper bag and in the car.<br /><br />They have 2 good-sized holes where I can easily string a paci-clip through, too.

The only complaint I have about these is that, since they are round, when they drop they can roll FOREVER!! if you are at home its not such a big deal but I have had to practically crawl under a car in the Wal-Mart parking lot to retrieve one.

The hospital gave him several of these pacifiers during our stay even though they suggested not to use pacifiers at all since I planned to breastfeed which to me was just not possible since he needed something to comfort him while he was not eating. I continued to use and bought more in many different colors until I realized the part that sticks out is dangerous. The pacifier stabbed him in the eye when it fell out his mouth and he rolled over while playing. If you plan to use please understand supervising your child at all times still leaves possibility for injury because they move quickly and anything can happen in a split second.

Amazing how things change!<br /><br />My son is about a month old and has reflux, which is apparently really common in newborns. Suckling helps the reflux - which means he was nursing constantly - CONSTANTLY. Sometimes 3 to 4 hours in one session. Now that he is back up to birth weight, he was given the clearance for pacifers and bottles. This is the only pacifer that he took to - and it has saved my sanity. Probably his, too. Now that he's not getting a constant supply of milk, his number of spit ups has decreased. But he is still suckling, which helps the reflux. And he's not suckling on me, which gives my body a chance to recuperate. He flat out rejected other pacifers, except this one. I also like that it has the finger hole - I can hold his head with one hand and still have a finger in/on the binky to help hold it in place, and still have another hand free.<br /><br />Buy one pack.

I live in Singapore and it took a while for the package to reach me and in the interim managed to find a more traditional style pacifier from Pidgeon but  with an olive shaped teat.  It's possible I would think more highly of the soothie if I had not tried the Pigeon pacifier first.  My baby  will take the soothie but does not prefer it over the pigeon one.  The problem with the Soothie is that it falls out of his mouth really easy.  If he lets up sucking for a moment it falls out of his mouth.  If it happens to roll out of his cot (which seems to happen more frequently than a regular pacifier) it always lands teat side down (regular pacifiers are more likely to land teat side up).  Additionally there is no cover for the soothie and it is more difficult to teather to a stroller or car seat so it is not a great pacifier to travel with.  In short:  I will use the soothies as back-ups as baby will take them but will not be buying more as a regular pacifier with an olive shaped teat is better,2/2/2012

It is true that all babies are different, and they all have mouths of different shapes and sizes.

It did calm her right away and I liked that the design was shaped slightly like a breast nipple.    The pacifier did change her latch slightly so we try to use it as little as possible.  The biggest down side for us was that she can't keep it in her mouth.  It falls out or she spits it out every few minutes and starts crying until we put it back in.  For her the MAM style of pacifier worked better...it didn't rub on her chin and she was able to keep it in her mouth.  I think the Avent Soothie works ok, and may work well for another child.

We never had an issue with it causing troubles with her breastfeeding.  I know several other breastfeeding Moms who use this pacifier too.  My daughter has now found her thumb, so prefers that to a pacifier, but I really liked this pacifier.  Plus it is easy to clean as it is one piece.  We did buy and try the gumdrop pacifiers as they have the same nipple, but are shaped to fit their face - they have a curve to the base and a cutout for the nose.  My Daughter didn't like those as much as her regular soothie.",4/28/2011

(And I spent a lot of money on various brands). They are durable and last a long time..and the ring make is convenient to hold on your finger or use with a pacifier clip. The only thing is that they are sometimes hard to clean. When you use soap and water, it gets inside the nipple. In order to get it out, you have to cup your hand with water while squeezing the nipple. This gets some water inside to wash the soap out. After that, I always throw them in the sanitizer.

It is easy to attach the pacifier and although it will only attach to pacifiers with a handle it will attach to most. My Son cuddles this bear and looks for pacifier on the end. The only problem is that for his age and dexterity the weight of the bear pulls the pacifier out of his mouth. So, I believe it will work better when he is a bit older.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Easy to clean<br />- Easy to attach<br />- Crafted well<br />- Eyes are plastic<br /><br />Cons<br />- Weight of bear pulls the pacifier out easy<br /><br />Suggested for a little older than 6 months",5/27/2014

I chose Binkibear because I liked the idea of the detachable pacifier. As it turned out, I made a good choice because my grandson has never really cared much for pacifiers. He's 4-1/2 months now and he prefers chewing to sucking most of the time. This bear is at least twice as big as the other animals that have the attached pacifiers, making it the perfect size for an actual stuffed toy. He will pick it up off his play mat and hug it and chew on its arms or legs. Maybe when he has a bit more dexterity he'll put the pacifier in his mouth now and then. For now it is a cute, safe toy.

It took some effort but I WAS able to do it (see the pictures I uploaded in the product images).<br /><br />The directions I got with the bear state that it can be tossed in the washing machine - pacifier and all - but I have not done that. It's a personal preference, just not sure how safe it is to get laundry detergent on a pacifier, even if it's rinsed. So I wash the pacifier by hand with hot water and replace it when necessary.<br /><br />When I first bought this my baby (then 8 months) did not like this bear because it was a bit heavy and it kept pulling the pacifier out of her mouth. Within a few days, though, she really got used to it. Before buying this, I was going nuts in the dark trying to locate the pacifier in her crib, and the fact that she has designs on her crib sheets didn't help matters because it was easier to lose among them! I purchased this bear to solve my problem, and it solved my baby's problem, too - when she starts crying at night she locates the bear (easy enough to do, even half asleep), puts the pacifier in her mouth and falls back asleep in no time. This bear is a lifesaver!<br /><br />EDIT: Dec/2013 - I recently had to replace this for my almost 2-year-old as she broke the loop. The original one I bought came in a drawstring bag with the green pacifier pictured as well as a clear plastic flat pacifier that looked like a teether. Now I spent more money (originally bought for around $11, this time bought for $15) and the pacifier pictured and the teether pacifier no longer comes with it.

This thing is too cute, the nipple is too large for a new born but should be usable after about 6-9 months. There is no ring or ledge for removal from a baby's mouth or to attach a pacy clip to. This shouldn't be a big deal because this should probably only be used under CLOSE supervision due to the nipple size, weight and materials used. Let's face it, though it can be used by a child it doesn't look like usability was the main goal when making this. Laughter was. It's built well and will work.

However, it was made with such poor quality material & so badly designed that it is really a huge waste of money.   The plastic on the outside is so brittle, that if it falls on a hard surface, such as concrete, it is prone to shattering, leaving sharp, jagged edges that you would never put near your baby's mouth. Also, it doesn't take long before the closure no longer closes all the way, defeating the purpose.  Furthermore, the clip is just as fragile. The handle that opens & closes the clasp snaps off much too easily, rendering the clip useless. I had to replace both so many times that after 6 months, I gave up entirely & went with another brand, MAM. Both the pacifier & the clip are made of much sturdier materials & the design of the clip is such that the moving parts are much less likely to break off. You're better off just keeping pacifier wipes handy for when it gets dirty. The cost of replacing the pacifier & clip so often far exceeds the cost of the wipes.

50670215,R2U5IJEFRRQS77,311600177,2,36,43,N,Not what I expected,"I had high hopes for this pacifier, as we have 2 dogs and 3 cats and my son's pacifiers get instantly covered in hair as soon as he drops them. Even on a pacifier holder, they would fall onto his clothes or blanket & pick up dust and hair instantly. So to say I was excited about this product would be an understatement. Here is what I wish I had known before I purchased it:    The keep-it-kleen pacifiers DO NOT AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE! They have a mechanism that keeps the cover open, until it is jarred/knocked, at which point it snaps shut. This is great for pacifiers that fall on a hard floor from a substantial height, but when it just gently rolls or falls from my son's mouth when he is in his car seat or stroller, the impact is not enough to make it close, so it just stays open, lying on his shirt/blanket/whatever picking up hair.     Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, it does not have very good air flow, so the inside of the pacifier tends to fog up instantly and I'm not sure this is very hygienic.    In summary, I guess that a pacifier that closes some of the times it is dropped is better than one that never closes (ie a regular pacifier), but for the price, and the fact that it doesn't work in both large and small drops, I would not recommend it.",2/11/2010

I ordered this 5 pack right away after that and have not been disappointed.  The only thing I do not like is that this brand does not make a pacifier clip.  I ended up using a JJ Cole pacifier loop that can loop through the hole on the end and then clip to her clothing.

13114242,RQCTC4K93C1U4,343148814,4,0,1,N,"Unfortunately, this is the best option","I tried almost every pacifier on the market. I wanted my LO to use the Nattursutten pacifier because it's made of all natural rubber and is one piece (no space or hole for bacterial growth) but even though I purchased the butterfly shape, it was so big that it covered my LO's nose. And my LO is quite large for his age so it wasn't because of his size.  Other moms complain about the same design flaw, too.<br /><br />My second choice was the Gumdrop pacifier because although it isn't made of the same high quality material as the Nattursutten, it was one piece so again, no holes for bacteria to grow in.  But the pacifier was so heavy that my LO couldn't keep it in his mouth and I didn't want my LO to have to use so much force when using a binky.  Just logically speaking, I would think the LO's jaws would hurt from holding something so heavy for so long.<br /><br />So then I tried Advent and Dr. Brown which were lighter in weight but also covered the nostrils.<br /><br />I ended up using MAMS pacifiers only because they were super lightweight and didn't obstruct my LO's breathing at all.  But they are a pain to clean- the part that the LO sucks on is hollow so soap and spit get stuck in there.  After awhile, it turned murky in color despite my obsessive washing.<br /><br />As soon as my LO was older, I again tried the Nattersutten.  Still same problem- covered his entire nose.  Back to Gumdrop and thank goodness, this time, my LO was able to hold it in his mouth on the first try.<br /><br />I'm still not 100% satisfied with it because I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy and why the nipple is hollow (makes cleaning a pain).  Oh and the design makes LO look like Hannibal Lecter.  It's a bit disturbing to me.  Haha. But for now, my concern about bacteria growth in the MAMS binkies outweighs these issues.<br /><br />Until Nattersutten creates a pacifier with a deeper dip in the nostril area, I recommend the Gumdrop version.",12/27/2014

I saw a friend with one & thought I definitely needed a pacifier that would glow in the dark! Very disappointed. It doesn't glow unless left in the light and even then only glows for maybe 30 minutes. I thought that by the looks of it that at least some of the stars would glow but no, just the ring.

It is not symmetrical and has an up and down side. So, in addition to be as hard to find as a regular pacifier, I still have to figure out in the dark which side is up and down.

The handle is the part that glows in the dark (not the whole pacifier).   This feature makes it easy to find the pacifier if it falls out  within the first hour of putting the babies to bed.   My only complaint about the pacifiers is that there's a nose cutout only on the top, but the babies are old enough to put the pacifiers in and take them out on their own, and the babies don't know there's a right way....   so the pacifiers end up upside-down about half the time and slightly poking them in the nose.

37273240,R1YEH2DOIQM2VN,364133280,5,32,34,N,Great pacifier; helps us keep organized!,"We have several of Avent's 'regular' pacifiers at home, which my daughter likes and uses on a regular basis.  When I purchased these, the glow-in-the-dark feature was not important to me, as I really didn't expect the glow to last for long (c'mon folks, it's glow-in-the-dark - the technology hasn't improved much since 1985...haha).  As other reviewers have noted, the glow really does not last too long after the lights go out.<br /><br />I'm sure most parents who use pacifiers for their babies would agree with me on this - we have pacifiers floating all over the house, but it seems whenever you want one, none can be found.  For this reason, I did like the nighttime pattern on the pacifiers; it helps my husband and I to remember that those are the 'bedtime binkies' and when we find them around the house, to put them back into her bed, so we *always* have a pacifier for bedtime.  Yes, the base of the pacifier is larger than Avent's 'regular' design, but I find that the larger base prevents the pacifiers from falling through the slats on my daughter's crib, which happens to the 'regular' design frequently.  Perfect if she wakes in the night; she can find her binkie and replace it herself - which she does.  I'm really pleased with these, as I have been with all Avent products I have purchased.",2/9/2011

The zebra's shape makes it easy for my 4 month old to hold onto.  She puts one hand up by the pacifier and wraps the other arm around the body like it is her little buddy. It also makes it easy for her to put the pacifier back into her mouth if she wriggles and it falls out.  I think she only favors this one because she is drawn to the black and white of zebras. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because the Soothie pacifier is glued in so it can't be changed and the size of the pacifier is 0-3 months.  My daughter is a preemie with an adjusted age of 7 weeks so physically she can use it for another month or so before I should be putting her on larger pacifiers and then eventually the orthodontic shaped ones.

Now that he is learning to use his hands, he loves to grab the kitten and pull whatever part of it he grabs (usually a foot) into his mouth. To wash it, I just throw it into the washing machine with his clothes and let it air dry. It turns out great. The kitten is high quality and should hold up to quite a bit of stress as he gets older.

This could happen with any pacifier I suppose - but I just wanted to let people know. I bought another and within a few days she chewed a hole through the nipple again. So no more of these for her!! She must have razor teeth or something. She now has been using the regular soothies (she had newborn ones from before and the 3+ month ones) and hasnt manages to chew those up.

I'd read a lot about Wubbanubs and Soothies (the pacifier brand attached to the Wubbanubs) being a great option for holding.<br /><br />LOVE Wubbanubs! Took a few days/weeks for little one to warm up to using a pacifier but she loves her Wubbanubs. I bought the tabby kitty to keep in her crib and we use the ducky for going out. The necks are easy to use a snap-on pacifier holder ( a friend had gotten us one from Etsy with a thick hairband on the end). They're super easy to grasp for little one. It was the first thing she learned to really grab well and to pull back into her mouth.<br /><br />They sit so well on her chest. I like the kitten over the ducky for this reason-  it's a bit wider so it sits really well. And I just realized I can (LOOSELY) tuck it into her swaddle so that it's easy to find again. I just did it for the first time and little one has been starting to go through a sleep regression and she just woke up, found it, and went back to sleep! Holy crap. Why didn't I try this sooner?!<br /><br />Anyways, I've tried regular pacifiers (even Soothies) since and she spits them right out. She liked to hold on to the little stuffed guys. I definitely recommend and I think I'm going to start getting them for baby shower presents, since you probably can't have too many.<br /><br />I will say, I wish I could take off the paci to boil but I wash it with hot water and soap every once in a while and throw it through the wash occasionally (especially the one we take out of the house). And I have stuck the tip into a boiling pot of water before too really quickly but watch you don't burn yourself with the steam.",10/31/2013

36548204,RS89L4A8PGJFT,380619977,5,0,0,N,Best Binkies Ever!,My daughter has 4 different WubbaNub pacifiers (or binkies as we call them).  She's been using them since she was a few months old & they were perfect for those late nights when her binky would fall out & she was able to push it back into her mouth & go right back to sleep.  I had used the plain soothies with nothing attached when she was first born & I spent countless nights being woken up because she lost her binky & couldn't get it back.  These are great.  About once a week I toss them in my lingerie wash bag & wash them & they come out practically dry.  About an hour on a drying rack & they're good to go.  Do not put other items in the bag though because any fuzz or lint will cling to the pacifier part & you'll have to rinse it off.  I usually rinst them off in hot water anyway right after they've gone through the wash.,12/2/2012

29731525,R1BA0VNAL0J6B2,380619977,5,1,2,N,"Hospital style pacifier, Great for little hands and They never get lost!!","I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The tabby kitten is my favorite.  I have noticed that it is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear. Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket. I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",4/28/2012

The soothie pacifier is the only kind my baby likes, but I was constantly having to pick it up or hold it in her mouth for her.  She was too young to hold it in her mouth herself.  The wubbanub is weighed down by the attached stuffed animal and it rests on your baby's chest.  So if it does fall out, it can usually be recovered by your little one.

However it wasn't until I opened the package yesterday that I was disappointed (I'm due soon); the directions say to wash the pasi - got it, no biggie.  The animal - wash gentle dry low, got it.  Then as I was inspecting the product I realized the animal is sewn together WITH the pasi.<br /><br />This didn't make sense to me.  So you're supposed to wash the animal in the washer, with the pasi attached to it, allowing any soap you might use in the washer to soak into the pasi.  Or you could not use any detergent but either way I'm sure the pasi can't be washed in a washer too frequently.<br /><br />You can't remove or reattach the pasi unless you take the stitch out and then restitch the (or a new) pasi into the mouth of the animal.  I was expecting some clip or tie or something else other than permanent attachment of the two objects; for cleaning purposes this is completely unpractical.<br /><br />I gave it two stars instead of just one because it is adorable. It is another baby-item that may or may-not work depending on how my child takes it.

When it does fall out of her mouth, she tries to put it back in, although at this point she usually ends up sucking on a leg or tail instead.  :)  This little guy might seem a tad expensive for what it is, but I would buy another one in a heartbeat if this one got lost.

38085442,R16SXYJLPWW94F,381226741,4,1,2,N,More easy and comfortable to suck than Soothie,"My baby is now 5 months, and she has been using this pacifier for her naps and nighttime sleep since she was about 1 month old. I gave her a Soothie to use before, and bought this thinking I'd only use it as back up or when we go somewhere because it has a handle that I can attach a holder/clip.  The first time I had my baby used this, I could see by the way that she was sucking it that it was a lot more comfortable and fit better in her mouth than the Soothie. Because the nipple is softer, more flattened, and has a narrow base, the pacifier stays in her mouth better than the Soothie.  It will stay in her mouth sometimes the entire length of her nap or for a few hours each night before falling out, even after she stopped sucking.  With the Soothie, it kept falling out of her mouth as soon as she stopped sucking.  The other day, I tried to give her her Soothie back to try again, and she sucked it and it fell out of her mouth. I kept putting it back in, but either she pushed it out with her tongue, or it was falling out because of the way she was sucking (she was used to how this pacifier kinda &#34;hangs&#34; in mouth better because of the narrow base and fatter nipple). So I actually tried sucking on both pacifiers myself - this one is MUCH softer and natural feeling than the stiff, straight nipple of the Soothie.  If I was a baby, I'd definitely prefer sucking on this one! I personally think it probably resembles a real nipple more because of its soft, compressed/flatter nipple.  I breastfeed, and when my baby feeds, my nipple looks flattened when she pulls off.<br /><br />The only negative about this pacifier is that water gets into the inside of the pacifier whenever I wash them.  I always wash them by hand with some warm water and soap and ALWAYS get water into the nipple.  It leaks in somehow from the base.  I don't think there's a way to take of the base without breaking it to clean the inside.  But I guess it doesn't matter because that part doesn't come in contact with my baby's mouth.  It is unsightly though seeing water spots on the inside of the nipple (makes it look dirty). We have really hard water though, so that may be why.  I always shake the water out as much as I can and let it air dry before giving it to my baby.",8/9/2015

Not only is it difficult to get out and clean, I feel that it's unsanitary to give to a baby if you don't sanitize it in hot water after every use. I sanitized it in hot water for 5 ~ 10 minutes before use and my son did not accept the pacifier at all which I don't mind because it would be a pain to sanitize after every use. The only positive thing about the pacifier is the cover that it comes with because if it didn't I would have given it one star.",7/16/2011
51974622,RREHDLP7301CK,381226741,5,0,0,N,Nice Looking,"I like these pacifiers.  They are nice clean and basic looking.  They are easy to clean and the plastic doesn't get all nasty looking, it stays nice and clear.  The only problem I see is something that is the same with all the pacifiers I have bought...water gets inside the nipple and eventually makes the inside of it have a cloudy look.  That doesn't effect the outside of it though. The plate of the pacifier has plenty of air holes to help with air circulation around the skin.    The best thing about these is there is no top or bottom to it.  This is good for a baby learning to put his own pacifier in his mouth or a half asleep baby grabbing for it in the middle of the night.    These come in a 2 pack of blue and red or green and orange.  Any are good for boy or girl.",4/30/2011

They also have the handle to be able to hold them without touching the nipple.  My baby hasn't decided if she loves them yet, but that doesn't stop me from loving them!  The only thing I don't like is that you can't pick the color here.  Colors and Designs may vary.  I received a yellow one and a blue one in my package.

Also you will need to clean around the base of the nipple part where it attaches to the hard plastic. There can be buildup of milk, formula, food, etc. you will want to clean out. Again, just dip the nipple part under hot water then use your fingernail or a towel to wipe the buildup away from the base. DO NOT SUBMERGE - or it will squeak when baby uses it (which kept mine awake bc of the noise it made) and grow all kind of nasty mold inside the nipple. Just dip it into hot water.

Even other parents stop me and either rave about how great they think it also is, or they want to know where I got it. My daughter started teething at three months, and while looking for things that would work for her teething I came across this style binky! Our main obstacle with such early teething was her not quite being able to grasp toys well enough to hold up to her mouth. This toy helped so much as it allowed her to hold onto one part of the toy and still be able to use the binky without having to hold onto a small binky itself and try to navigate. It is also easier to be able to hold her with a binky, I can have one free hand because the toy part of it allows the binky to stay in place. It makes a fun toy as well! She loves spying her binky and getting to play with it and feel the softness of the toy.",8/4/2015

I hadn't considered it would have been made with such low quality- especially for the price. I honestly thought it was a joke. I received a plush toy that resembles something that would come with a child's fast food meal only with a pacifier sewed into it's mouth. This product makes sanitizing the pacifier a chore and washing the plush toy separately impossible. If considering purchasing this product I suggest making your own- find a low quality stuffed animal around the size of your hand and sew a binky into it's mouth.,2/14/2015

I mean, if you want a pacifier and a little stuffed animal, why do they need to be stuck together?!? And then when our son still wasn't really hooked on any particular pacifier after the first couple weeks, and after one long evening of paci-spitting and fussing, I figured we might as well try the Wubbanub. Our son loved it pretty much instantly! And the genius design of that stuffed animal meant the paci couldn't drop out of his mouth and get stuck under his neck/head. It rested perfectly on his chest while he was tiny and stayed close and easy to grab when he was a little bigger. And while I fully expected him to abandon it by the time he was crawling, he loves that thing still! It's lightweight enough that he never minded it dangling from his mouth as he became mobile. He's over 20 months now (entering the territory of restricting it to the crib, car, and emotional moments), but it's easy for us to grab and hang onto with a toddler on the go. With him on my hip and the paci in his mouth, the giraffe is long enough that I can hook a leg or tail between my fingers in case he jettisons the thing. I'm actually ordering a new one because he finally chewed a hole in his and I don't have the heart to take it away. Can't believe I'm buying a Wubbanub for my toddler, but a lovey is a lovey for a reason, and he sure does love this giraffe.",1/30/2015

I even went so far as to buy another one because it was working so well. Even though my daughter is now almost eight months, we still use these as her 'night-time' pacifiers for the reason above. Not to mention I think she finds comfort even in holding onto the animal even if the pacifier is out of her mouth.

37046645,RGSGV7N7AV8M6,392768822,5,0,1,N,My favorite baby purchase!!,"I bought this when my son was a couple weeks old because he favored soothie pacifiers and I loved the idea of being able to more easily find the pacifier, having something my son could hold onto, and having something that sort of propped up the pacifier while he was too young to keep it in his mouth well enough on his own.<br /><br />This has met all those expectations wonderfully! I've since purchased two more for when my son drops his in gross places and they need to go through the washing machine. In between washes in the washing machine I wash only the pacifier part and it's not too difficult. Once in a while the tip of the giraffe's nose gets wet but that's not a big deal and it dries quickly.<br /><br />I should mention that I've seen other WubbaNubs and knockoff WubbaNubs and so far the giraffe is my son's very favorite. It's longer than the others and narrower and more easily stays on his chest. Now that he's 7 months old that's not important because he can keep the pacifier in his mouth and he can also put it back in his mouth if it falls out. But when he was smaller it was just the perfect size to sit and stay on his chest. He also loved holding the giraffes ears. When he first learned to grab at things he'd grab the giraffes ears happily and by default would hold the pacifier in his mouth better as he was falling asleep.<br />I only add these things because choosing which adorable stuffed animal part was difficult but I had to keep getting the giraffe because of those reasons!<br /><br />One more reason to get this is that once babies can reach for things and put things in their mouth these are even more amazing. My son drops his and can easily find it and put it back in his mouth. He also loves to play with it as a toy! I can imagine him loving this for a long time, long after outgrowing pacifiers.<br /><br />Best purchase. I don't know how I would have made it through the infant months without these!!!",6/24/2014

They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animal for girls or boys.<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone.<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth. She has also learned over time to guide it into her mouth on her own.<br />4. Durable - after several washes in the machine, it seems to be holding up just fine.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe.<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning.",3/23/2014

With the small animal attached to the pacifier it made it easy for her to search for it in the middle of the night without the assitance of my husband or I.  Then around the age of 2, the pacifier actually broke off of the stuffed animal due to wear & tear (my kid would hold onto the pacifier with her teeth and pull it out of her mouth constantly).

It is meant to help a baby hold on to the pacifier or be able to grab it and put it in her mouth, but our daughter was more interested in sucking on the stuffed animal than the soothie, so it was not too helpful. Also the stuffed animal is pretty tiny and it's pretty inconvenient that the soothie doesn't come off since those wear out in a month or two of use.

The animals are the perfect weight/size to help keep that pacifier from rolling around in the dark and easy for them to grab. It didn't take long before our baby was self-soothing and we never left the bed. It is now an item our toddler will not go to bed without. We have 2 - the giraffe and monkey. I must say, the monkey is probable the cuter of the two.",10/16/2013
52860758,R14I22488XYOKV,392768822,5,0,0,N,BEST IDEA EVER,"Firstly, This Pacifier has a round end on it. So if your baby is not used to this type of pacifier, they might Not like this one.  It is Permanently attached to the stuffed animal, it does not detach for cleaning!  The stuffed animal is lightweight, stuffed with cotton. I like the Wubbanub because it is Easy to Find, no more going crazy trying to find the small pacifier!  Even very young infants can grasp at the animal pacifier, it is amazing to watch them, holding onto the  Wubbanub, thusly holding onto the pacifier!  Somehow it keeps the pacifier in babys mouth, especially while baby is lying down.  At night it is invaluable for a parents good nights sleep; if your baby loves the pacifier!  I've found the perfect way to keep the pacifier clean, just buy the pacifier wipes and use them to keep it clean and sanitized. This Giraffe is Loved so much that one  stays home and  one is even kept in the diaper bag, heaven forbid we loose one!  I really like the Giraffe because it is so easy for little hands to hold onto so many of the little legs. This Wubbanub should be looked over occasionally, just to make sure there are no holes or stuffing coming out, this is Not a Teething Toy!, remember it is, just a pacifier with an attached stuffed animal!<br />.",10/11/2013

And then we found the wubbanub. Even when she was very young, she could hold onto this pacifier. She loves the pattern, and she enjoys chewing on all parts of it. It's also easy to find, and hard to lose - a winning combo. There's something extra special about the giraffe. We have a little duck wubbanub too, but the horns on the giraffe and the weight of the feet just make it perfect somehow....Whoever invented these is genius.

My baby loved to hold it while she sucked on the pacifer and even when she stopped taking pacifiers altogether at about 2 1/2 months, she still loves this giraffe. She holds it while she sleeps, in the car, and now that she has started teething she loves to chew on his legs and horns. Great buy for as happy as it makes her!",4/13/2013

With my first during sleep training, I was constantly getting up in the middle of the night to make sure the pacifier stayed, and I feel like it my first heavily relied on the pacifier to go to sleep.  Now that I have this, the weight of the giraffe allows the pacifier to stay near #2's mouth - if she moves her head and loses the pacifier, she can easily find it, or it stays with her.  Also, #2 sucks on the pacifier then turns her head and goes to sleep - I feel like the fact that the pacifier is so near she can use it when needed but then spit it out and fall asleep.<br /><br />The actual product was smaller and more lightweight than I anticipated, but I do love this product.

My recommendation is to use this early on but try to get your child to use a different pacifier during the day before they get too used to it. Our daughter only uses a pacifier for naps and at night but if she needs one during the day we're trying to get her to use a standard pacifier.

With our first child we used traditional pacifiers and we were constantly having to put it back in our child's mouth when it would fall out. But not the Wubba! This toy/pacifier is ingenious! It cuts down the need to replace it in the child's mouth drastically. If baby is sleeping with their head tilted to the side you can gently position Wubba so it is a prop up to hold the pacifier in baby's mouth. When baby is on their back looking up at the ceiling you place wubba on their chest and even if their little mouth relaxes and falls open during sleep, Wubba holds the pacifier gentaly in place so when baby seeks it -it is there! Before you know it little one will be holding on to it (great for helping to develop dexterity) and its too cute! We used to joke about how we wished there was a type of pacifier headgear...

Anyway, we'll probably buy a back up unit (always gotta have backup units for everything for babies!) but would prefer better quality control.",5/20/2011
30680008,R1B2MD3CDV6MJO,392768822,5,0,0,N,Perfect!,This has saved my life.  Our newborn couldn't keep his binky in his mouth but wanted it so we would have to sit beside him and put it back in every 5min.  With this it weighs just enough to keep it in his mouth but light enough that if he doesn't want it he spits it out or just turns his head and it's out. Now at 3mths he holds onto it and falls asleep...it's so cute.  He can even put it back in his mouth,4/25/2011

It makes the pacifier so easy to find and as your little one gets older it is also a little stuffed animal they can take along.

29823616,R1LJ786H6FDSRY,392768822,4,163,182,N,great product after surgery,"So, when i saw this product i loved it! but i knew that my 3 month old baby would hate the pacifier part. the only paci she ever takes is the NAM kind because they have bigger bulbs at the end for her to suck on. Also, other pacifiers are shaped too similarly to her milk bottles and she gets mad that milk doesn't come out of them. I also wasn't thrilled that you had to wash the paci with the toy. So being a crafty mom, i knew i could fix this so she would like it. I got it in the mail yesterday and as i predicted she just spit it out. so i took my seam ripper and got the pacifier off easily without hurting the toy. then i took one of the holders for the nam which come apart and there is a hole at the end where the tie for the clip goes through - it was the perfect size for the hole i had made. a few stitches and viola! popped the pacifier in the holder (i also like that it can spin around in the holder) and we were good to go. she had been crying for about 15 mins, i put it in her mouth, showed her how she could grab on to it and she was sleeping within minutes. she has fallen asleep with it 4 times since then. so, like i said - i loved the idea of this product but had to make it work for me. just an idea for some of you other crafty moms (or dads) out there ;)",3/11/2011

Perfect for the car, or for babies that are swaddled (it sits on their chest without little arms to fling it away) .  My little one loves holding it, and playing with it's ears even if she is not in the mood for the pacifier.  We have the horse, the giraffe and the elephant.  The elephant does not stay put as well as the other two because it not attached to the most solid part of the stuffed animal.",3/1/2011

This is the only pacifier she uses and only when she goes to sleep.  She quickly finds it in her crib and doesn't need to have 5 pacifiers in there with her.  . It is soothing like a normal pacifier but also soothing in a tactile way.  It goes perfectly with her Lovey which is an Angel Dear Blankie.,2/28/2011
27378710,R293HP64F15D1D,392768822,5,0,0,N,Great Product,We love the giraffe.  Our baby is 3 months and she holds the toy which keeps the pacifier in her mouth.

Also by a few weeks old he would be petting them as he went to sleep. I had to return to work at 5 weeks and by 3mos he was sleeping 12 hours through the night with the help of this pacifier.  After the first couple of weeks searching for the pacifier in the dark (he was in my bed in a sleeper thingamajig for week 5-10) I found these!! I worried he would have too much of an attachment to the stuffed animal but he was off this and the bottle by 18 months.  Also, the pacifier is the one they use in the hospital so you don't have to worry about switching.  I washed it in the dishwasher and air dried and also just washed the pacifier part often.  we did lose a few at others houses and had to replace 1 or 2 when they were worn but for the extra sleep those first couple of months, it was well worth the $$$.",11/30/2010

CONS:   --> Only reason I'm giving this 4 stars: Paci doesn't detach so the animal AND the pacifier have to go into the washer  -Easy for baby to grab and she pulls it out of her mouth ALL THE TIME    I would buy this again and am tempted to buy a second one just in case we lose this one!!",10/19/2010

It does stay where its suppose to, but I think My lil' man still needs to get use to the pacifier, for he turns his head to the side alot and the pacifier doesn't want to stay in his mouth. I just think he has to get use to the fact, that the pacifier isn't going anywhere and that he can still get it in his mouth (that's why I gave it 4 stars).  I love that while its on his chest, he can grab onto the dog...it's seems to comfort him a little.  I would highly recommend this product to any parent.",5/20/2011

You could attach it to a clip, for example, or put a dot at the base in permanent marker. We've &#34;lost&#34; a bunch of these during childcare since they look so similar to other natural rubber ones.<br /><br />Another drawback: Drop it in the middle of the night, and you'll never find it. Good luck if you kick it with a toe while your baby is in your arms. It will find a way across the room to the point of no return until you put the baby down and turn all the lights on (maybe). Do they make glow-in-the-dark pacifier clips? If they do, they're probably toxic, and your baby shouldn't be in the crib with a binkie clip anyway.<br /><br />I still give this 5 stars because it's so well made and a great plastic alternative.",12/3/2013

He really seems to find these soft and pliable pacifiers to be very comforting, and I like that they were designed with breastfeeding babies in mind.<br /><br />My only complaint is that they do break down rather quickly and need to be replaced about every 4-6 weeks.

21452436,R3P55Z4YOOCOBE,424813274,5,1,1,N,These things are freaking great.,"My 4.5 month old has started waking up all through the night looking for her paci.  She is just barely coordinated to get her paci back in about 1/3 of the time (that I see, although she probably finds it sometimes and I don't even know).  Since she has figured out how to roll over, she only sleeps on her belly.  Mam pacifiers are great for belly sleepers because they have a low profile and don't get knocked out of baby's mouth when she turns her head, and they are super light so they stay in easily.  I have sprinkled like 6 pacis around her head at night to increase the odds that she'll find one.  Until now, she had been using the under six month size, but I wanted to get the 6+ size to see what the difference is.  The shield is a bit larger and so is the nipple, and the nipple is more bulbous at the end.  I haven't noticed that she has an easier or harder time keeping them in than the smaller size.  She seems to not care which size I give her.  The glowing is genius.  Only the knob glows, not the shield or nipple, so the glowing part doesn't touch her face.  Makes it a snap for me to find in the night, and I'm hopeful that it helps her find them more often, too!  I held them under the light for like 10 seconds before I put her down, and they were much dimmer but still glowing 12 hours later.",10/13/2012

Ok this might be gross and unhygienic but our daughter picked up another baby's paci and immediately calmed down and went to sleep (it was a Mam). what! that night I ordered these on Amazon and we will never ever use another brand of Paci. She loves them. I have no idea what it was...but these things are awesome. Right around when we got her these she started sleeping through the night (I can't directly contribute it to these but I can't discount it either).

I found some MAM glow in the dark pacifiers in the 2+ month version at a local store and she likes those. I can finally find her paci in the middle of the night when they otherwise get lost in the dark. When she is crying in the dark instead of feeling all around the crib searching for them it sure is handy to have the soft glow to help out. For those reviews that say they don't glow in the dark, you actually need to charge them up first by exposing them to bright light for a few seconds and then they are good for the night.",1/16/2012

With others I'm constantly feeling around in the dark or feeling around under the crib - with the Mam glow in the dark ones they usually retain enough glow for my husband and I to find them easily, and now my daughter finds them on her own which means less middle of the night crying sessions for us.  What more can you ask for?  I give them a little extra charge by holding them up to the light for a minute, which my daughter for some reason finds hysterically funny.

She is now exclusively on formula.  When we needed to supplement, I had a horrible time trying to find a bottle that she would take.  I started with the Lanisoh bottles and the Medela bottles because they are supposed to be the best for breastfed babies.  She would not take either of them.  Then I tried First Years Breastflow bottles and Avent.  Again, she would not take either of them.  You can imagine how absolutely stressful this was with a baby who was not thriving.  Eventually we found Dr. Browns and she did take them relatively well, but she always spilled so much formula while eating because the nipples are small and she couldn't &#34;latch&#34; onto the bottle properly.  This made for a big mess and also for a lot of gas because she was sucking a lot of air while trying to eat.  These bottles have BY FAR been the best I have tried with her.  She rarely spills a drop and she is not really gassy on these bottles at all.  Plus, the inclusion of the pacifiers is a wonderful bonus as this is the ONLY paci she will take other than the weird looking Soothies.  She latches to these pacifiers the best, and yes, I have tried MANY MANY brands just as I did with bottles.  These bottles are easy to clean and having the ability to sanitize them in the microwave is a HUGE bonus!!  I find that they don't leak as long as they are assembled correctly.  I also enjoy having the ability to make a 5oz bottle - many bottles only go to 4oz in the smaller size.  Overall, I think these are the best bottles on the market and I highly recommend them.

After a couple of duds, we found this.  It's great! My daughter is 18 months and still uses the small rounded size.<br /><br />First and foremost, it had to be safe.  And this is, in many different ways.  Made from natural rubber and oils, I am not concerned about contaminating plastics.  The shape is awesome; it cleans up easily and has no cracks for bacteria to hide when cleaning and sterilizing.  When it first comes out of the box, it is oily.  As others have mentioned, after you wash for the first time, instructions say to boil for a few minutes.  Let it cool and you'll see the oils have been tamed.<br /><br />My daughter loves this paci.  We once ran out of them after I noticed a crack on the side of the nipple (my fault - I let it go much longer than the recommended 6 weeks between replacement).  That was a very long a night.  I tried a few chemical laden replacements until I could get a new shipment in to no avail.<br /><br />All that being said, these are expensive.  And the cost doubles when you realize that you are supposed to replace them every 6 weeks or so.  Much longer than that and the pacifiers start to harden.  But for all the benefits, I will continue to use these and have some peace of mind knowing I am using the safest product.",1/29/2013

As a plastics engineer, even though many pacifiers are bpa-free I prefer the natural rubber for my child.<br /><br />My child started using a Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier at 3 weeks but was not a big pacifier fan until trying Avent Soothie at 4 weeks. Luckily we had received several as shower gifts. However the course of the next 8 weeks we managed to lose 3!  I also had read about replacing pacis at 6-8 weeks. I would agree with this when they're teething or if they reuse the same one frequently. But if you have enough to rotate than its bit necessary.<br /><br />I ordered these due to low Soothie supply & the age cap of 3 months. I like that these can go to 6 months instead.  My daughter has only tried for 1 day & although not as crazy about this one as the Soothie (they have to work harder because of the thickness & opening inside the paci) she likes it!

If you try the rubber pacifiers on your baby and he/she doesn't take them, I recommend this kind. They're BPA free and orthodontic. The curvature of the brim is perfect for not rubbing up against baby's nose (a problem in most rubber ones I've tried) and the holes in the brim make it so very little moisture gets trapped between their skin and the pacifier.

I did not like this at first, because the tip doesn't have a radial symmetry that I was looking for, only a linear symmetry.  I was not able to tell true shape of the tip based on the pictures. I was hoping that it would be more like Soothies, but with a more bulbous tip so that it would stay in his mouth better.  Regardless, it doesn't seem to bother him.<br /><br />My favorite part about this pacifier though, is that when he drops it, it almost always with the mouth-part up.  Or 'butter-side-up' as it were.  The oval part is heavier, perhaps on purpose, so it almost always turns the pacifier 'in-flight' and lands in the ideal position.  Of course, a tether would be even better so that it couldn't be dropped on the floor at all.  But as I mentioned my son isn't a fan of pacifiers, so we don't have one leashed to him 24/7.",7/2/2015

I introduced it at a little over month originally because she had such a horrible time keeping pacifiers in her mouth! She would get so frustrated and angry. While the WubbaNub didn't solve ALL of our issues, it certainly helped. My daughter is exclusively breastfed and isn't really fond of pacifiers, but she absolutely adores her WubbaNub tiger. Now that she's older (4 months), she likes to hold on to his little legs or pet it. She honestly spends more time with the stuffed animal part than the pacifier!<br /><br />Her caretakers at daycare noticed how much it soothes her. We forgot it one day and well, let's just say that wasn't a good day for anyone... I think it's adorable that it gives her both something to suck on (and sometimes gnaw on), as well as comfort with the stuffed animal. I'll be sad when we have to take it away when she actually starts sprouting teeth! We'll probably just cut it off the pacifier and sew it closed, ha.<br /><br />To clean it, I usually just wipe off the pacifier.

We got our first one even our daughter was 4 months old and we haven't looked back even though she is now 17 months and well past the she listing on the package. Mr Monkey helped our daughter learn to self soothe early on as it was easier for her to find in the dark of her crib at night and even before she could figure out how to get the pacifier back in her mouth she was at least able to pull his foot or arm up to her face and that seemed to calm her. We've glove through a few of them now that she has most of her teeth but it's well worth buying replacements as her monkey still is her favorite soother. When she's fussy we just ask her to go adds find Mr Monkey and that usually does the trick to calm her down.<br /><br />For those with concerns about keeping it clean, I just throw the whole thing in the washer (we also have the giraffe version of this so we always have one available while the other is being washed). When it comes out of the dryer I just hand wash the pacifier part to rid it of any fuzz or residue and there you have it, a fresh clean wubbanub. ;-)",2/21/2015

One other note....when we weened our son off of his pacifiers, we got him a blanket with a monkey head attached to it (it's cuter than it sounds) to replace his Monkey pacifier.

Well, the second expectation was true, the first wasn't. the animal isn't heavy or big enough to matter when it comes to baby spitting it out. He can still get it really far away and I have to put it back in. Also, to wash the paci you have to wash it in a washing machine, which is inconvenient so I just rinse off the nipple between washes but it gets the animal wet a lot of times, and then the animal part gets really dirty since I can't wash it in the washing machine constantly.

I was initially surprised because wubbanub monkey has always been a faithful, comforting friend. He would never harm anyone. But apparently, the wubbanub monkey is the new face of terrorism. He looks sweet and innocent, but I guess those are the ones who look really suspicious. After trying to explain to my daughter why they were taking her monkey away, the wubbanub monkey was placed in a bowl, given a visual inspection, and run separately though the x-ray machine.

11349817,R2DLU0JZLED7MZ,450475749,5,13,15,N,Great pacifier + lovie,"I've listed WubbaNub pacifiers as must haves for many of my friends who are having babies. Let me tell you why...<br /><br />1) They don't roll when they are dropped (or thrown)<br />2) They are a much more recognizable and grab-able when you are digging in a diaper bag or retrieving it from where it was thrown in your car<br />3) They have the same pacifier as what we were given in the hospital<br />4) They come in a variety of animals so you can get one that matches your baby's personality<br />5) They last a long time<br />6) They are easier to find in the dark than a pacifier alone<br />7) Your baby will be able to hold this and put it in his/her own mouth much sooner than a pacifier alone<br />8) Your baby will enjoy being soothed by the pacifier, but also enjoy carrying it around like a lovie<br />9) They are easy to wash - either by hand with soap and water, or throw them in with your laundry<br />10) They are very affordable considering how long they last and the preference your baby will show towards it<br /><br />Babies are funny - they seem to have a preference for one pacifier over another. We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter. That was embarrassing!<br /><br />We own the frog, turtle, brown puppy, and monkey. I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble.<br /><br />When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed.<br /><br />The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material. We inspect ours daily for grime and goo (and tears) and we wash them regularly. Also, as mentioned, we got to the point where the pacifiers were showing wear and tear and one of the pacifiers started ripping at the nipple. I am so glad I caught that before my child swallowed it on accident. This could happen with any pacifier though! Just make sure to wash regularly and always inspect the pacifier before giving it to your child.ifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do.

The wubbanub has helped our daughter soothe herself back to sleep and even learn to hold and grab when she was younger.  At night if she wakes up and needs a pacifier she will magically find her wubbanub, turn it around and put it in her mouth.  She started using the wubbanub at 2-3 months and now is 8 months.  I've read many blogs that say you can continue to use after 6 months, but to gauge if nipple is too small for baby.

My son never used a paci but my daughter clearly wanted to suck on something that didn't produce milk.  When our fingers were pale and wrinkly from being sucked on, we decided to get a paci for her.  She was blissed out with the soothie (first one we tried) so we stuck with it.  I got her the wubbanub thinking it would be easier for her to hold it and insert it in her mouth herself.  Maybe the problem was that she was already 6 months old when we tried it, but she didn't like how it pulled out of her mouth and would get very frustrated.  She also seems to find the stuffy by her face really annoying.  We're sticking with a paci on a clip.  Maybe starting with an infant would make more sense, though I'm not sure what you'd do when the paci needed replacing and the baby was attached to the stuffy?",12/20/2013

4257670,RI0U5P1PL5RWK,450475749,5,1,2,N,I love this monkey - I'd buy it again!,"The Wubbanub Monkey is great!!! Regular pacifiers fall out when the baby starts sucking on it and starts to pop it up and down in their mouth.  Very frustrating to keep putting back in their mouth especially while you're trying to get them to sleep.<br /><br />With the wubbanub monkey pacifier, you can spread out it's legs so the pacifier stays in her mouth as she pops it in and out.  The head weighs it down just enough to keep it in.  The position of the pacifier sewed into the monkey's mouth is a good angle to help it stay in.  I heard from friends that some of the other animals are not as good as the monkey for the angle.  The monkey is small and light enough that when she's turning her head back and forth (fighting to not go to sleep) and it gets on her face, she can still breathe just fine.<br /><br />I tried the pacifier clip before purchasing the monkey. The clip works well to keep it from dropping on the floor, but doesn't help with keeping it in her mouth.<br /><br />FYI: this does not keep it in her mouth all the time.  At times, she likes to grab it, yank it out, and sometimes toss it.  But it works well most of the time.  I'd buy it again.<br /><br />She's now almost 4 months old and has been able to grab it and get it into her mouth a few times.  She also loves to suck on it's legs and tail now that she's a little older.  So we only need one item to go out instead of a toy and pacifier.<br /><br />Other sleep suggestions:  From birth to about 2 months old, she just wasn't sleeping well at all, she constantly woke herself up when her arms would suddenly move - it startled her.  So with much trial and error, I found the solution to my baby sleeping all night: this swaddle sleepsack (her arms stopped waking her up), her monkey wubbanub pacifier (monkey keeps it in her mouth as she pops it in and out (most of the time), munchkin nursery projector/sound machine turned to heartbeat & projector, mattress at a slight angle (seemed to reduce reflux) = baby sleeping all night 6-10 hrs!!!!

I read reviews on this product and saw others saying it helped their babies to have something to hold onto, so I decided to check it out.  It is awesome!  My baby was able to figure out how to hold onto the toy to keep the pacifier in her mouth, and then learned to keep it in through sucking.  Now at 5 months, she loves to hold and pet this as a lovee, and she chews on all of the monkeys limbs when she isn't in the mood to suck on the pacifier.

15535825,R1TNKS7YGQWXHL,450475749,3,0,1,N,My 2nd wubbanub.,I always give 5 stars for wubbanubs bc my daughter loves them so much. SHe lights up every time she see them. They are perfect for babies who can't hold their binki in their mouth very well (much like my daughter.) They have flaws such as the cleaning hassle and the brand is in the works of making some for older babies (these are only meant for 0-6). Which sucks bc my daughter is 6m. At least they are trying. But what made me give this 3 stars is not bc of these reasons. i would still give it a 5. The pros totally out wight the cons. but why this particular one earned 3 stars is bc when received it had cotton sticking out of the stitches. It had a huge knot of thread where it was sew shut. The tail had no filling. JUst a long piece of cloth. THe whole monkey felt less filled then her kitty that she has. Other then that its works great. I was just upset about the quality. Shipping back would take wayyyyy to long as i am stationed overseas. It takes forever to send and receive mail out here so i just dealt with it. My daughter can care less about the threading.

After talking to my sister about it she let me know that it was used in the NICU and the nurses would stuff the animals down the onsies to help keep the pacifiers in the babies mouths. I've since been doing this and it works like a charm. My little one will continually spit out his binkie and then is unhappy because it is no longer in his mouth. When I put this monkey in his onsie he can go slack jaw and the binkie stays put in his mouth so that when he wants it again it is still there. I would recommend this item to everyone with a baby who likes to suck on pacifiers.,6/12/2013

One suggestion that I have is buy two..lol.. when my son started teething and drooling the monkey got pretty gross and smelly, and if your kid likes it as much as mine it is kinda hard to put in the laundry for a couple of hours.

Also, the way it is sewn on to the mouth of the toy, it pulls the pacifier out of the baby's mouth making it even more difficult for the baby to hang on to it then if it was just a pacifier without the toy.

The Wubbanub is a Soothie pacifier with an animal attached. I saw a friend with a Wubbanubs so I ordered one to try. It's been a life saver!! At 6wks old she clings to the animal. The weight of the animal helps the pacifier stay in her mouth especially when she's laying on her back or in the car seat. A tip when using the a soothie style pacifier,  put a finger in the whole while she's sucking on it, they like the way it feels.  We have the monkey, giraffe and duck. The giraffe is her favorite. Not sure why its more expensive though. And, babies r us carries these for only $10.95<br /><br />Regarding cleaning, there are 3 ways to clean/sterilize them.<br />1. Boil : Put a ziplock bag around animal, dip pacifier part in a bowl boiling water and let soak for 5-10 mins. This sterlizes It. At the end of each day  I take a a paper towel with soap and hot water and wash the pacifier part.<br />2. Dishwasher : I used the bottle basket and put on top shelf of dishwasher. Then let air dry.

He loves these so much and I love the fact that it is very hard to lose them unlike his regular pacifiers which are always rolling under the furniture or are just hard to see among his toys.    When he was a small infant, these were the only pacifiers he could keep in his mouth, because he could hold the stuffed animal part. That was a lifesaver for me because I didn't have to constantly give him back his pacifier when he woke up. Now that he is older, he doesn't need the stuffed animal part to help keep it in his mouth, but he loves the various animals he has. We are slowly trying to wean him off his pacifiers, but it is hard to refuse him his wubbas (as we call them) because he absolutely beams when he sees them.

We tried lots of different pacifiers, but he never really took to any one style. I thought I would try this because of the idea that it could help stay in his mouth. However, the results weren't any different from all the other pacis we tried. Maybe it works for younger babies but at 2 months, it would still fall out of his mouth when he turned his head so it didn't really keep it in place. To be fair, maybe my little one just isn't a pacifier kind of kid, which is fine, but we didn't have the success that so many others seem to have with this product. I was also a bit hesitant because of the fact that the pacifier is sewn to the plush toy but I was willing to deal with it at the time.

A pacifier can change the way the teeth grow in and a child's bite---and adult teeth are going to come in the same way the baby teeth are.  If you use a pacifier, I highly recommend using one with a better shape that won't impact the teeth as much.

I had read that babies that like the soothie but have trouble holding onto it like this pacifier, so I ordered it along with some of the latex nuk (the silicone are all I have in my area and my son hates them, my older son used latex and I read the latex is softer, so here we are 😊) well I sterilized them and then tried to use it, but the difference between these and the soothie is a slight bulb at the end where the soothie is more straight (maybe this is why it's easier to hold on to?). The bulb at the end seems to be slightly large for my sons mouth, he had trouble trying to get it in his mouth. So those were out. Maybe he'll like them when he's a little older ( my son was 6 weeks when we tried these). I would suggest buying these and the regular latex nuk pacifiers and see which they prefer. As a side note, I breastfeed as well as almost all of my friends and we all use pacifiers without any nope confusion, maybe it can cause it but i have never seen it, so if you're breastfeeding but don't agree with the breastfeeding nazis that you should be a pacifier as well as a bottle give the pacifiers a try because i think the risk must be minimal of nipple confusion.",9/1/2014

I love them because they are natural rubber, made of one piece (so no hidden moisture/mold/bacteria issues) and have the lowered curve to go below the nose. The handle is also super easy for my baby to hold and bends easily in case she falls asleep with it and rolls to the side. It doesn't poke her in the face like others I've used. We also have the Ummy and while it's similar I don't like how big the base is...it covers too much of my baby's face for my comfort, despite the holes in it. It's also harder to figure out which way is 'up' when it's dark and I'm trying to quickly put the pacifier in so she can fall back asleep...having the dipped curve in the base makes it to much easier. Since the whole thing is rubber my now teething baby likes to gum the entire thing when she's not using it for its intended purpose. It's kind of funny to watch.  I was at Whole Foods the other day and saw the Eco Piggy, which I almost bought to try but didn't based on the reviews of the bulb part being huge. So I took it out to look at it and sure enough, it's massive! Unless you have a mammoth sized baby I'd skip that one. We're both happy with the Natursutten so I'm sticking to this one.

The pacifier is really soft. I know they make harder ones for teethers but these are the softer ones for newborns and non-teething babies. It's very easy to clean and long-lasting. We're actually still using the green one we got from the hospital but having spares make it easier if I have to clean them then I don't have to worry about not having a pacifier available if it's being sterilized. I sterilizes them in boiling water and they stand up to the heat very well.<br /><br />These pacifiers does tend to get stuff like lint and hair stuck on them because of their sticky-ish surface. I don't use napkins or cloths with lots of fiber to wipe them otherwise they get fury. Most of the time I just run it through warm-hot water and maybe scrub it a little with my hands then let it air dry.,3/9/2011

He never got the hang of latching onto it so it kept falling out of his mouth or he'd just push it out with his tongue.  We purchased the Sootheis just to try them and he loves them.  It hasn't interfered with breastfeeding at all (my one concern about pacifiers in general).  It's also really fun to look inside the little hole when he's sucking!",2/17/2011

49517010,R3NTV2FGO18CGM,456437823,4,0,0,N,A Good pacifier for newborns,"We weren't sure at first if we were going to use pacifiers. I didn't want to have the problem of having to keep putting it back in for him to sleep. However, we found a happy medium in using them. They really are a great transitional piece. What I mean is if you are in the car and he's hungry and you need to buy 10-15 minutes to get home to nurse, letting him suck on the pacifier will keep him from a total meltdown. It also is invaluable if he has missed his sleep window and needs the soothing of sucking to settle him down. We tried the other kind that has the wider rubber piece, but I found it would make him gag. I bought these at the grocery store late one night when we were desperate and couldn't find our others and this one was hospital recommended. They are a good pacifier. A few drawbacks to me is the little handle can be awkward and the breathing holes aren't very big. Having said that he had a easier time using this one than any others and the nipple wasn't too big for him as a newborn. Now we only use it occasionally when we need to buy some time to get home and he's hungry or tired. Be careful not to keep these lying around where pets can get to them, because we have found our cats love to chew on these!",9/28/2010

So he's actually self-weaning and just chucks these out of his crib and across the room. Pretty funny. My husband and I wanted to give our son the choice to use it himself. He still does use these very occasionally, but he's now happier without. With his older pacis, he would scream if we even tried to take it. These, he gives up voluntarily and easily. I don't know if that's by design? But anyways. At 19 months, he wasn't talking much with a paci in his mouth and now he has the freedom to speak his mind. Awesome.

It was a bit of a frustration for the first 6 weeks because my baby could not keep this in his mouth for too long without assistance. However, I wanted to stick with it because it's the only pacifier shaped most similarly to a real nipple, and I didn't want to introduce the chance of nipple confusion with a different pacifier.<br /><br />Right at 6 weeks, he was able to handle it much more consistently. At 8 weeks, he could keep it in his mouth all by himself. Now, at 11 weeks, he's quite a pro! I no longer have to reach over and help him keep it in his mouth.<br /><br />One day I gave him a different pacifier brand (received this different one as a gift), and I noticed that he had some difficulty latching to the breast for that whole day. Back to the Soothie, and no problems since then!  I ordered two packs of the 3+ month size from Amazon. I saw them in Rite Aid, but they were a bit more expensive. It would be perfect if it came with a case. I ordered a separate plastic case.<br /><br />Any basic pacifier clip with Velcro attachment can work to clamp it to baby's shirt. The pacifier has two holes so you can put the strap through the hole and keep it at hand.",6/28/2015

These Soothies have saved my sanity many nights and are excellent in that I dont have to worry about water collecting in the pacifier BUT the older (and chunkier) my infant is getting the more her little thick fingers are get stuck in the center of the pacifier. When learning to pull her pacifier to her mouth and play with it she almost always gets her thumb stuck in the pacifier center. I am a hawk over my baby so her finger never stays in there for long but the suction created makes it difficult to remove the pacifier from her finger at times.

14420389,R2T3CXEB1I8R2L,473538559,5,0,1,N,Great pacifier,"My older son always used Nuk pacifiers, and our baby only likes these. Each was/is totally devoted to their pacis. Having experience with both types, I prefer this kind. Here's why:<br /><br />These are all one piece. The Nuk's would get a little bit of water inside of the nipple when washed/boiled, and over time would get cloudy and gross inside, and little bits of dust/grime would get stuck in the seam between the hard plastic shell and the nipple. These get totally clean and there are no seams or areas for water or grime to collect.<br /><br />These are all the same semi-soft material. Our baby will chew on the edges to help with teething, and if he face-plants while sucking/chewing (which happened a LOT while learning to crawl) there are no hard areas to hurt him. Landing on the edge of a Nuk can hurt a little.<br /><br />The only annoying thing is that these bounce like crazy when dropped. We have hardwood floors through most of the house and they can easily end up 10 feet away if dropped from adult height while holding baby. We probably have one under most pieces of furniture at our house at any given time. So just accept this and buy a bunch so you have backups. On the plus side, my 3-year-old thinks it is fun to go on a &#34;pacifier hunt&#34; and see how many he can find while slithering under furniture.",6/17/2014

With our other wubbanubs, they wobble and don't stay in place as well.

All wubbanub animals aren't equal. The turtle is great for when your little one is lying/sitting fairly still since it can lay flat on their chest.  We also have an elephant and a giraffe.  We have the elephant in the crib since you can make it 'stand' for when she lies onber side, makeing it the perfect height (upside down worked best when very small). The giraffe as you would imagine has a long skinny neck so it flops around more. Great for when they can wrap their arms or hands around it to hold it in, but bad when they move their head alot as it tends to get flung or stuck under their head.",6/24/2014

The pacifier used is not the same quality as if purchased by itself (less durable/softer) it is also not detachable therfore you can't replace it or sanitize it. You have to wash it by hand or in the washing machine which will degrade the material.  I also don't like that they used sand/small filler (think &#34;beanie babies&#34;) in the feet as weights, to me this poses a safety issue.  Repeated washing and babies chewing/sucking can be hard on things and the only thing separating this choking hazard is the stitching.

Our baby was given a soothie at the hospital but we needed a way to keep it off the floor. This thing is a great solution. It is easy to spot across the room. When she spits the pacifier out it will usually just sit on her chest and she can sometimes get it back in on her own even without hands. Now that she is getting older she really seems to like the animal more and more. She pets it to soothe herself to sleep and now that she is interested in toys, she always has one near (even when we forget all her other toys).

It solves that problem very well!      I also bought a paci-plushie at the same time. Paci-plushie is a pacifier holder so it works with wide variety of pacifiers so you don't have to use the soothie if your baby prefers something else.  Plus, if the paci wears out, you can just buy a new $2 pacifier rather than a whole new toy!  That just makes more sense to me.  My baby happens to gladly take whatever pacifier we give him so both work for us.  I am only knocking off a star because I think that the idea of a removable paci makes much more sense.

The other design is that there isn't a correct way to use the pacifier which is easy when the baby can put it in their own mouth.<br /><br />Negative - This has absolutely nothing to do with Avent and everything to do with Amazon.

I had previously used the AVENT Orthodontic Infant Pacifier for 0-6 months. The (0-6 months) pacifiers had symmetrical nipples as well as mouth guards, so no right side up or upside down. As my baby grew and it seemed as if he was almost able to swallow the whole pacifier I knew it was time to get a larger size. So because he had been using the Avent ones with no difficulty I purchased, what looked like, the same product but in a larger size. But that wasn't exactly the case. The NIPPLE was symmetrical but the mouth guard was not. It wasn't a huge deal really, I didn't return the products. We purchased both the clear and clear with blue center. The blue colored ones were easier to find, especially at night.<br />I will say that we are lucky that our baby decided he didn't want/need to use pacifiers at 8.5 months on his own.<br />These were very useful for us while we needed them.

I read the reviews and was a bit concerned with many reviews saying that it was very difficult to open, some saying impossible. I was concerned as I have Fibromyalgia and can hardly open jars, heavy doors and other things with my hands. I took the chance and bought one, hey it was only $3.99 with free shipping! When I received the case I immediately went to open it with the provided latch and yes it was difficult but I found a more than easier way to open the case. If you squeeze the two sides of the case, it instantly pops open. I barely have to put pressure on the case and its quickly open. Yes, I realize the latch should be easy to open but I found this way worked and seems to be a great way. This easily fits two soothie pacifiers in the case. The clip is a little flimsy but I believe it's made that way so you can clip it on nearly anywhere. I think an improvement would be an actual caribeanner clip to ensure it doesn't fall off. Although I have not had the problem of it falling off. It's so wonderful I purchased another one!",1/6/2015

The pacifiers I have are the newborn size, so if you get a bigger pacifier there's even less space for it.  On the plus side, it does seem to lock pretty well.  I did have trouble opening it from the tab at the top; a work around it so just squeeze the sides and it pops right open.  It has an open side on the clip, which allows you to easily attach it to something.  I also bought the NUK carrier, and it's pretty much the same thing (just more expensive).

I initially wanted to use these so as to eliminate the possibility of nipple confusion - however we soon realized that wasn't a big deal as she was doing great nursing.  We bought some of the Avent infant pacifiers and she loved those. They have a small 'bulb' shape at the end - so as she's sucking, she's keeping it in her mouth.  We had no problems with those being spit out.  I've seen a few babies successfully use and keep these style pacifiers in, but most I've talked to start with these and then soon move on to the Avent pacifiers.

This bear makes it so easy to find the pacifier, especially in a car seat.<br /><br />The only thing is that it is a little harder to clean than a traditional pacifier that can be run through a sterilizer or through the dishwasher.

They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute pink animal for girls!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning",10/8/2013

Because you finally do not have to get up every 2 min to put the soothie back in after your baby spits it up!<br /><br />My baby played a game called stupid soothie and mommy, where she would suck the soothie until mommy got back in bed, waited 2 min for mommy to get comfy, and BAM, spit it out, or with the help of her tiny long fingers, hurl the soothie right out of the crib.  I swear I would get up at least 20 times with each time I put her in the crib.  I was growing so frustrated.  Then while reading some forum, I kept seeing references to Wubbanub, due to the odd name, I looked it up, and it was like a bright light had shined on me!  I was saved!  I ordered one immediately, and life has been a bliss ever since!  My baby would also go into crying spells in the car, when I drove and the soothie fell out, and I had no way of getting it back into babies mouth asap.  The Wubbanub has stopped all of this drama.  The bear design in particular works better than some others, the month of the bear is bigger and holds the soothie down and in the mouth.  We also have the giraffe, and while cute, the mouth of giraffe where soothie is connected is thin and longer, and the soothie doesn't stay in quite as well as with the bear.<br /><br />Additional tip: if you put a blanket on top of the bear, it stays in even better, less risk of slipping out.  Also, after the initial wash/soothie boil, instead of boiling everyday and getting half the bear wet, I bought pacifier wipes that work well to get all the grime/germs off.<br /><br />This has seriously been a life saver!",4/21/2013

49268655,R1ZTGAR5NMDF2F,52203997,3,0,2,N,For a very little one = MEH,"Perhaps I was expecting more of a miracle paci based on reviews... my DD was born at 32.5 weeks and we can't keep the darn thing in her mouth (as most of you paci users already experience).  I decided to give this one a try, hoping that maybe if the paci fell out, it would still stay close enough for her to get back in her mouth on her own.  No such luck.  Also, when she starts vigorously sucking, she gets all excited and starts to pull on the animal, causing the paci to come out.  My sister had one of these with her DS a couple years ago, but I remember the animal being a little more weighted than this pink bear... per another reviewer, perhaps the quality has changed a bit over the years?<br /><br />The nice things about this paci is that it's cute as heck.  Also, when the paci does fall out of her mouth, it doesn't go too far - a problem I had with the paci alone falling on the floor and then me needing a few backups on hand in case I couldn't wash it right away.  I think this would be great for on the go - less likely for this bigger thing to fall out of the carseat (I don't think I quite trust a paci leash with my DD being this little).<br /><br />The one thing I don't like about this is that you can't remove the paci from the animal, so it makes washing a little tricky.  I'm used to having to sterilize everything daily for a preemie and this one you can't really throw in the dishwasher or in the steam basket.  The only way to sterilize is to dip it in boiling water and trying not to get the animal wet.  Based on reviews, doesn't sound like a good idea to throw this guy in the washing machine.  Plus, I'm not sure if I would want my DD's paci in the washing machine anyways.<br /><br />I am hoping as she gets a little bigger and if we decide to stick with a paci, that this will work out better for us.  But at little over 2 months (over 2 weeks gestation), it's not quite as great as I had hoped.  Keeping my fingers crossed that it soon will!",2/20/2013

29731525,R3LY7RP9AUKBCM,52203997,5,0,0,N,"Lov, Love, Love These.  Same pacifier given to babies in the hospital!","My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth.  I frantically purchased several look-a-likes when we came home.  Even at the her tender age of just a few months old, she was not to be fooled by these silly knock-offs.  I had a diva on my hands and she wanted nothing less than the real thing.  I finally discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors like [[ASIN:B000ZEXKJE GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack]] and [[ASIN:B007VSM3CM Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green)]] for preemies. Finally we were saved!<br /><br />During my search for the holy grail of pacifiers, I came across these wubanubs and bought them mostly because they were super cute.  And since I was starting a collection of pacifiers, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try.  Love, love, love these.  And my daughter does as well.<br /><br />First let me begin by saying that the pacifier, on these precious dolls, are practically identical to the make and material of the hospital variety and perfect for my little one.  They are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night.  My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth.  I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown.  I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier.<br /><br />Although, they are a little pricier than a traditional pacifier...you save money by not having to purchase another two pack because you don't know where the gazillion others you purchased went.  I have yet to lose even one of these.  They also make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It appears to be a somewhat  meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib.  So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills and actually pacify.<br />There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures like this one [[ASIN:B0031W38YO Wubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Mango Monkey]]. The [[ASIN:B0028H3ACS WubbaNub Tabby Kitten]] is my favorite.  I have noticed that this one along with the Tabby cat is slightly smaller than the other ones I've purchased but my daughter loves it just the same.  The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush; however, I have cut the pacifier out of just one after its seen some wear.  ( Just as a caution.)  Once you stitch the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with, unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump. They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends. When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.<br /><br />Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",8/30/2012

18444426,RLHPKRNE32H9N,523549949,5,0,0,N,Some quirks but my son's favorite,"My son is fed via a combination of breastfeeding and pumped milk. We've tried A LOT of bottles and he prefers the MAMs over everything else. For him, the nipples on Dr. Browns and Born free are too long. He hated the Avent Naturals because he had to smoosh his face into them to get a full latch. He is OK with Nuks but he prefers the MAMs. I think that the shape of the nipple just really works for him. It is wider and flatter than most bottle nipples. They say it mimics the breast - that isn't our issue as I use a nipple shield. He also seems to have less gas, due to the venting system. That all said, it is true that these can leak from the base if you don't assemble them correctly. It has happened to me, I know now to double check the base before I pour milk in. In addition, the venting system in designed in such a way that if you heat up milk directly in these by putting a bottle in warm water, you'll get water in the underside that will drip out when feeding. Since the plastic is fairly thick on these, I just heat up the milk in a Medela bottle and transfer to one of these to feed.",3/23/2015

Plus, if you put too mUch water in, during the steam function, all of the water spills out on your counter and if you aren't watching the steam cycle for the full 10 minutes, the water can spill off of your counter and ruin your hardwood floor.

17597890,R3HBNJDSAV5OGO,531834407,3,2,2,N,Great Idea But Not Our Favorite,"The idea of the product is great. These are wipes that you can use to clean pacifiers, sippy cups, bottle nipples, teethers, or whatever if they happen to fall on the ground (or get thrown...) and you are nowhere near a source of water or soap and can rinse things. They come in a convenient little package, they are disposable, and fit into a diaper bag along with the several other different types of wipes a mom must carry around with her.<br /><br />I purchased these initially from Amazon once, because I had never seen them in stores. Immediately after receiving them in the mail I noticed them in stores, for a significantly lower price than what I had paid. So I stopped buying them on here. I also now prefer [[ASIN:B004HM368U Munchkin 36 Pack Arm and Hammer Pacifier Wipes, White]] instead of the First Years ones.<br /><br />First of all, these are indeed wonderful for when you are not near soap and water and can't rinse things off. But for most people, that is not really often enough to justify the purchase of the wipes or having to carry them around with everything else crammed into a diaper bag. In most situations where I couldn't rinse off something in a sink I didn't have these wipes, I usually had a bottle of water I could pour over the item to rinse it. That's not to say that these aren't useful if maybe you are on a long road trip with few rest areas where you can buy water or rinse things in a bathroom sink, or if you are camping, or if your baby is screaming in the middle of the store and you need to sanitize her pacifier quickly and don't have time to dash to the restroom to use the soap and water. In such cases, these are very useful. But its not an everyday occurrence and something to think about before stocking up on multiple packs.<br /><br />There is the issue with the chemicals and the possible residue. That is why I like the Munchkin brand better now, because these left a sort of oily feeling residue and the Munchkin ones left none. But I do prefer an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item. They have an odd scent which I think is some sort of sugary flavor left on the cup or toy or whatever so the baby doesn't taste the cleaning chemicals. I'm not sure if that bothers me or not, as it is probably a necessary evil. Unfortunately it seems that my daughter didn't like the taste because after using the wipes she never wanted her pacifier, and made a disgusted face when pulling it out of her mouth. She stopped using her pacifier at 3 months. So maybe use these to wipe your pacis down when you are trying to wean your child off them.<br /><br />All things considered, these are pretty good for situations when there is no soap and water, but these are definitely not a replacement for soap and water.an oily residue over possible bacteria or fungus that might have otherwise been on the item.

Have a pack that was opened a year ago and wipes are still wet and ready to use. They are kind of like baby wipes you use for changing diapers but without the soapy like feeling so there shouldn't be a bad taste when your kid puts the item back in their mouth after being cleaned with these.

Not only are they made of natural materials (better for the environment and less likely to have toxins), they are adorable on...think Maggie Simpson ;)<br /><br />You do need to heed the manufacturer's recommendation and replace every few weeks (like you would a toothbrush) cause they kinda flatten out and become tacky.

I didn't realize I needed one until I was at the pediatricians office with my two month old and another mom showed me what they did while my daughter kept spitting out her pacifier.  Quickly, I ran to amazon and purchased the pacifier.  It took a couple days to come in but the shipping was super fast and I immediately cleaned it and put it to use.  It works great.  My two month old is just getting to the stage where she is starting to grab for things in reach and she likes her pacifier sometimes when she is over tired (despite my best efforts for naps) to help her settle down.  I haven't used it in the car yet, which is where I need it most, but I'm sure it'll be great.  It's nice that it stays in range and when she spits her paci out she can easily get it back in with a little effort.<br /><br />The only downfall I see with the design of the product is that you can't take the paci off to really clean it.  Yes you can wash it in soapy water like the instructions say and I did that.  I just wish I could run it through my dishwasher like I do the other things to make sure it's really sterilized.  But, then I'm kinda germaphobic when it comes to my little one.  Definitely worth the price and definitely a great idea.<br /><br />The fabric is super soft and the little caterpillar is just the right size that my daughter's tiny hands can really grab onto it.  She seems to like the soft feel.  The little feet have beans in them so that it helps the animal stay on her chest when she is laying in her car seat or swing and needs a little extra soothing.  The pacifier is sewn into the stuffed animal part so there is no worry about fingers or anything getting caught in a loop or something like that.  The fabrics are bright and cute.  I love the little thing!",8/5/2015

(As is, since 2010, the American Association of Pediatricians). I know they're not for everyone, but taking our five year old's away when she was 2 was no problem at all - and some studies have shown they help prevent SIDS.

I think it's because it's a little harder to hold than the monkey because the body is so short.

Great for situations like driving when you can't get back there to replace a fallen pacifier! I give these as gifts to my friends now when they are expecting.

'God Bless Plush Lamb' wubbanub is one of the better ones out of the bunch but mine arrived with some stitching and cosmetic defects (I'm hoping this is an isolated issue as we've had no trouble with our other wubbanubs so I'm not deducting from the rating).

As the kids get older this was the one pacifier they could find on their own in the crib which meant more sleep for me. Depending on the child, and their teething, the pacifier end would last about 6 months. As for cleaning I would run the nipple under the sink with soap or put it in the washing machine with my other clothes and let air dry for a really good cleaning.

30322151,R279PLJJVBBJC0,572944212,3,0,0,N,The other shapes work better.,"After a recommendation, I bought 3 wubbanubs.  The caterpillar, the zebra and the pink giraffe.  I bought the caterpillar first and chose that one because it was the only one shaped like that and I mistakenly thought that would be easier for my daughter.  I was very pleased with it at first because my daughter did try to hold it and it did seem to make a difference.  I bought the other 2 for variety (you seriously don't need 3). The giraffe and zebra have the same basic wider shape and both are a squishier then the caterpillar and my daughter essentially hugs them. The giraffe is slightly larger than the zebra so it is even easier for my 4 month old to hold onto.  She puts one hand up by the pacifier and wraps the other arm around the body like it is her little buddy. It also makes it easy for her to put the pacifier back into her mouth if she wriggles and it falls out.  I gave it 3 stars because the other animal shapes work better and because the Soothie pacifier is glued in so it can't be changed out. The size of the pacifier is 0-3 months.  My daughter is a preemie with an adjusted age of 7 weeks so physically she can use it for another month or so before I should be putting her on larger pacifiers and then eventually the orthodontic shaped ones.  So it is a shame that she can't use it as she grows because it has become like a little friend to her.",1/25/2014

The attached animal really keeps you from losing it.  A bit pricey, but too cute to pass up.  Babies love to hold on to the stuff animal, and it helps with propping it up so the soothie doesn't always pop right out when they stop sucking.  My daughter was out of the pacifier stage by 4 months old, so it hasn't been used since.<br /><br />I love it, but I give it 4 stars because the pacifier can't be interchanged (it's sewn onto the product) and it can't go through the washing machine, which means you have to buy a new one if you want to use it long-term.  My friend's son has had his monkey one for over a year, and I believe she does put it through the washer.  It might be worth trying, but I didn't want to risk ruining it.",12/6/2013

Originally I did not want to use a pacifier, but after a week at home I realized it would only help both of us since she needed to suck to soothe before falling asleep. After trying a couple different pacifiers and nipple shapes, I realized she liked Soothie pacis best.<br /><br />I really loved the little elephant and honestly thought we would be able to replace the pacifier part, unfortunately that is not the case. Still I thought it was so cute!! Also, when I swaddled her for nap time it really helps being able to just lay the stuffed animal on her chest while I rock her to sleep. When she spits it out it does not fall to the ground or tugs and swings off like when I use to use pacifier clips. Will buy again when it's time for a new one!!",10/14/2013

We just throught the elephant (smoothie and all) into the washing machine once a week.  I was reluctant to pay this kind of money for a pacifier but it is one of our favorite baby products, and it is most definately the baby's favorite product!  She holds on to it and can find it at night if she looses it!  You could make your own by just sewing a small something to the end of the pacifier but this is the perfect size.

She told me they are suppose to hold the paci in place and keep it from falling out of the babies mouth even if they stop sucking. She said the feet were weighted to hold the whole thing on the chest of the baby. It sounded perfect, especially for the car seat and when my little girl is laying on her back. Unfortunately, there are many things wrong with this product. First of all, the pacifier is permanently attached to the stuffed animal and can not be removed to be cleaned properly. The weighted feet have a few little bean bag beads in them which do not keep it still at all. As soon as my daughter moves even slightly, the thing pulls right out of her mouth. Even when she's asleep, She has to lay perfectly still to keep it in her mouth...as soon as she moves her head, it comes out and she wakes up. At least with a regular pacifier, when she lets go of it, it falls away from her face. With this, when it comes out, its still in her face and sticks her until she gets frustrated and starts crying... If it doesn't keep the paci in the babies mouth, I'm not really sure what good it is...",4/26/2013

It's not hard to spot clean the animal part & wash the pacifier part. At 2 months baby would sometimes get ahold of the legs & pull it out of her mouth to her dismay but now at 3 months she can grab ahold of it & stick it into her mouth if she wants.

We got great use out of it.  My daughter was able to maneuver the pacifier and put in her mouth once falling out at a month or at least a little after one month old.  It's easy to spot if it happens to fall so losing it was pretty slim.  Once we started seeing the fabric starting to wear thin (this was after a year or so use) we replaced it...well that and because my husband and I are über nostalgic we decided to replace the caterpillar with a new one so that we could keep her first and put it in her memory chest.<br /><br />We receive many compliments and questions as to where to purchase them.

I realized that the reason she did not take to the new one at first was because it did not smell familar to her.Now she loves it as much as her monkey and I can wash the other one finally...as she will not do without one :) It is PERFECT in every way,it's a pacifier and her lovey/security,she will only take the pacifier when she's sleepy but she will grasp the legs and hold on tight and cuddle with it.BEST OF ALL: I don't have to dig for a paci EVER!It is so easy to find any time any where.She has a hard time holding one in her mouth(preemie) and this helps her to keep it there and when she does not want it she can just move her head and it falls out/away but stays with her.These are very durable.One of my baby shower gifts from now on.<br />Suggestion on washing:I take a mesh bag(zipped) or pillowcase(tied at the end) and drop the Wubbanub in and throw it in the washing machine on gentle cycle,let it air dry then wash the pacifier with warm/hot soapy water or use a pacifier wipe and we are good to go.<br />I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS ITEM OR ANY WUBBANUB :)",11/9/2012

We had a WubbaNub already on hand, and were happy to discover that the nipple is the same as is used in many NICU's. Having the weight of the stuffed toy rest on his chest meant less times of getting up to replace the soother for him. As he grew, he was able to grab the soother in the middle of the night to use on his own. He now plays primarily with the stuffed toy. Since he's older and rougher on them, we purchased a few more to ensure we had replacements. We are overall very happy with the products and the designs, but one of the ones we purchased was missing a lot of the stuffing and was exceptionally dirty. We ended up throwing it away.

At 6-weeks old, she was able to wrap her arm around her bug, which helped keep the soothie in her mouth. This meant longer spurts of sleeping for her and me. She's now 5-months old and absolutely loves her bug. She's never far from it and can put it in her mouth all by herself. She'd be devastated if anything happened to it, so just ordered another one for back-up.<br /><br />At first I was concerned about keeping the plush part clean since it doesn't separate from the soothie, but it's a non-issue. The wubbanub washes very easily in the washing machine and air dries quickly. I just zip it inside a boppy slipcover before putting it in the wash so it doesn't get beat up by the machine.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for any parent who is frustrated when their baby's soothie keeps falling out of their mouth.

Unfortunately, my dog chewed it up. I loved the product so much that I immediately came on here to order a new one. The elephant was gone, so I chose the caterpillar. Great choice! I think it helps keep the paci in her mouth even better than the elephant. My daughter is now almost 8 weeks old, and she even looks like she is physically holding the caterpillar when she uses it. It will fall out of her mouth but stay close enough that she can root around and get it back in there quite often. Plus, it is adorable!

Only at over 5 months old now, it has become a bit of a distraction when trying to get her down: she loves to play with it (giraffe is what we have, which is totally cute) and the stuffed animal is something to tug on, thus pulling it out of her mouth.     I vowed to give this as future shower gifts and just sent the Ella Bella elephant one to my sister. I hope her new little one likes it, I haven't gotten any feedback yet. I have now been searching for a binky that is of similar feel but without the stuffed animal - something that won't be distracting for when we are trying to put her down.

They are of hard but yet soft plastic so no fear of her breaking them, they have a little handle with a hole so I use a paci holder, they are the exact same size as the gumdrop we got from the hospital.<br />They are great for breastfed babies from my experience, as they reproduce the nipple quite nicely.<br />They do not leave marks on the baby face while sucking on them, and fall of the mouth easily when they stop sucking - i like that as compared to some others that they keep the whole time even after they passed out.<br />So far I have still been using the same one for the past 2 months so they are durable.<br />They also wash well : dishwasher or mild soap, the water does not get stocked into it so I feel it is healthier/cleaner than other ones.<br />Overall very satisfied",7/1/2014

However if your little one is used to sucking on a regular round nippled bottle these would probably work fine. Overall I think they are worth purchasing if your baby can suck on them.

However, he arrived 5 weeks early and with a very weak sucking reflex, so we have used these to help teach him how to suck.  The hospital had the soothie type pacifiers, but my son never figured out that he was supposed to suck on it.  It seemed too stiff for his weak suck reflex. Compared to the MAM pacifiers we used with my older son, I like the design of these much better.  They seem to fit better in my son's mouth, especially being much smaller.<br /><br />We initially used them right before I would breastfeed him to get him practice sucking and then quickly transfer him to the breast.  In addition, we have used them for very brief periods of time (like diaper changes or baths) when he gets very upset, as he tends to gulp air and then spit up more.<br /><br />Since my son was premature and is just now breastfeeding well, we are slowly using these less and less, but will likely reintroduce them when he is a little older.<br /><br />My only complaint so far is that I had no idea what colors we would be receiving.  I was actually hoping for more gender neutral and we ended up with bright primary colors that would have worked for a boy or a girl, but some color selections would be nice.

I had gotten this when my daughter was 3 months old and it is so nice that when she starts fussing, the pacifier doesn't fall out of her mouth completely.  She's holding on to mr toutou, so once she's done fussing, she just sucks on the pacifier without me needing to put it back in her mouth.  This is also great for car rides.  When she wakes up in the car, he's right there for her.  No need to scream or have mommy reach back to find a pacifier and put it in! She's almost 5 months now and after seeing how well it worked, I bought a backup- Elliot the elephant, a replacement pacifier and the soft teethers that attach (not a necessity yet, but she still enjoys the textures).  Everything is high quality.  I would recommend this over the other brands that don't detach from the stuffed animal because the pacifier part needs to be washed off a lot in our pet friendly home and I think its gross to put a pacifier in the washer/dryer.  It would get nicks and cracks in it much easier and common sense says that's where bacteria likes to live.  The pacifier itself is very similar to our advent soothie pacifier and I never worry about it being pulled off the stuffed animal by her- it's secured by three round nubbins that push in to a soft plastic on the dogs head.  Even if it did fall off, it's the same exact size as her soothie.  I really recommend this product and will be ordering one for each and every baby shower I attend!",12/3/2013

The size of the nipple is much better then that big berry nubby thing that looks like a ring pacifier - that is way too big for her mouth and the nubs all over the nipple part seem to be uncomfortable for her.    What I don't like:    She is 4 months old now, we got it a month ago.  She is teething and chewing on things, but could not hold/manipulate this until recently for any length of time.  Wanted a nipple that she would suck on and the nubs would be right under her gums if she bit down - this doesn't have that, nubs are only on the sides.    It's still too big and bulky for her to do much - and we don't give her a pacifier during the day now except at naps.  So this was a bit of a waste of money for us.

The larger one we had gotten as a gift has a cover than closes when it falls, but my wife doesn't like that because she thinks it will leave a mark.

We don't just put one or two in the crib, we put four, five or six.  When our precious child wakes in the night and gives a cry, we can see on the child monitor that our baby reaches out to find a pacifier, and once in the mouth, our baby goes back to sleep.  WONDERFUL!!  Before, we were sleep deprived when awakened during the night over and over and over.  Now... having to get up in the night is an unusual night, versus an every night trip.

The one pictured shows a separate syringe and separate medicine dispenser where the baby could suck as you push the medicine in OR you could just have the medicine part separate so they can just suck on it like a pacifier.

The one I recieved is an all in one that I could buy at any Walmart, Target, etc.  I wanted the one pictured because it is separate and easier to dose small amounts.  The one I received is a white syringe with a clear pacifier nipple and the smallest dose amount you can dose out in it is 2.5mL.  I need one to be able to dose 1.25mL so this one is not even one I would order in the first place.  Also, the nipple part of this is HARD AS A ROCK.

33613187,R1CJD17JHXW5DZ,658527424,4,1,2,N,Works great when kid rejects medicine,One day our kid realized he could protest the administration of medicine and to our surprise he was quite good at rejecting it. After struggling a bit and failing to be able to use the syringe/plungers that come with the over the counter medicines we purchased several products to try something else. This was the best out of the ones that we tried and we have been using this exclusively for several months since.<br /><br />You can use this as a syringe to suck up the medicine from the bottle but for something like Motrin where the dosage is a small volume I found it  more accurate to use the one that comes in the Motrin box and then transfer it to the mini medicator. This method does require you to be careful and can make a mess. So my only knock on this product would be that it is not easy to transfer medicine to it if you do not use it as a syringe. After squirting medicine all over the kitchen in the middle of the night one time I have gotten the prep down now.<br /><br />As far as administering medicine it works quite well. The shield prevents spilling back out and the design shoots the medicine off to the sides of the mouth which does not choke our kid if he's on his back like the out of the box syringes would.,2/10/2015

She sucked for a few seconds and then threw it across the room! Every time I put it in her mouth, she'd do the same thing. I thought I'd try sucking on one to see what it felt like for her, and immediately my top lip was pinched between the hard plastic outer piece and the soft silicone. No wonder she didn't want to suck - it hurts! The other one did the same. I also noticed that the nipple has a very apparent and somewhat scratchy seam around it.

36517980,R1GC9YIKP4M9WT,707645997,5,12,12,N,Love these pacifiers!!,"We used Nuk orthodontic solid piece silicone pacifiers until he outgrew them around 5-6 months. I loved that they were one piece (easier to clean), silicone, and orthodontic. I went on a pacifier hunt for several months until I finally found these! These are the almost-perfect replacements. All other pacifiers in our house have been tossed.<br /><br />Here's what we like:<br /> - The nipple has an orthodontic shape that my son doesn't spit out (which to me means it's a good fit). It also has a bit of give so the nipple can be sucked in a little harder if wanted; occasionally my son will play with that feature. I assume it simulates the flex of mom's nipple. Also, the narrow part of the nipple (between the lips/gums) is slightly textured. This also helps the pacifier stay in baby's mouth.<br /> - Although these pacifiers are not one solid piece, the silicone part is very wide and covers the whole mouth area. If you've ever used a pacifier where the mouthpiece connects directly to the plastic shield, you've likely seen just how nasty they can get at the connecting area- where you can't clean it!<br /> - The solid vertical 'bar' on the shield is great. It doesn't stick out so far that it gets knocked out, yet it's easy for my son to grab it to pull it out and put it back in. You can also use a pacifier holder there (like the BooginHead PaciGrip).<br /> - The mouth shield has just enough dip under the nose and curve to the cheeks to fit nicely without digging in anywhere. My son has big cheeks and some pacifiers dig in on the sides; this one doesn't.<br /><br />Ultimately any pacifier that stays in and can be thoroughly cleaned is a huge WIN! in my book. My son is 12 months and the 6+ months size is still great for him. It probably would've been a little too big right at the 6 month mark but babies grow fast.<br /><br />The negative reviews here are due to the colors may vary lack of color choice- not due to the pacifier itself. Yes I wish amazon let us choose- but sometimes you just don't have that option, and you as a consumer take a chance that you may not love the colors. Deal with it!! We've bought 5 packs over a couple of months and received: 3 red/blue, 1 green/teal, and 1 pink/purple. I'll likely save the pink/purple for a gift- or in case or pacifier emergency!",1/11/2014

Other than that, the pacifiers are decent. I have a few others that are identical i bought elsewhere.  It's nice that the water can't get trapped in the nipple like so many other pacifiers, but there is still something to hold onto.  I have a baby boy and of course, like others, received pink and purple in color.  Annoying, but I'd just use around the house if I had to.

So now is used as a toy, they like to test their motor skills with it, just don't put it in their mouths.<br />What I liked about the product:<br />- It's BPA free, but honestly, most baby product are.<br />- Doesn't have cracks which makes it easy to wash.<br />- it's made out of rubber. This is convenient if your baby likes to fall asleep with it and then rolls over it.<br /><br />What I don't like about the product:<br />-did you look at the price??? $9 for a pacifier is a little too much. Particularly when pacifiers are a hit or miss kind of a thing.<br />-it does have a funky smell at first.<br /><br />In my opinion this product is not worth it. Is way too expensive for what it is and there are a lot of reasonably priced products out there. Keep in mind that if your baby likes it you'll need a few to keep around.

After I sterilized it I rubbed coconut oil on it and rinsed, it helped but didn't fully get rid of the smell.<br />Other than the smell, it's great! It touches baby's nose, so for breastfed babies it's more natural feeling and there's no yucky, questionable ingredients.. that's why I bought it!",8/11/2015

They are easy to find, and don't get lost - I have exclusively used one binky for the last 5 months compared to the dozens I had gone through with my other two kids by the same time, saving $$ as well! (They are also much easier to find than just a single little binky in the dark or in the car!) 2. My baby has learned how to put his own binky in his mouth MONTHS earlier than my others did. Since it is so much bigger - much less dexterity and coordination is necessary to get it in his own mouth! 3. It STAYS in place. This is the kicker for me. Especially as a newborn, before they really have the suction power to keep their binky in - when they spit out their bink half-way, it doesn't fall out completely = less trips for mom and dad to put it back in their mouth! 4. Although this is just anticipation, when it's time to wean off of the binky, I think it will be much easier to just cut off the actual binky and let them play with the animal for comfort. Hopefully it will be an easier transition by letting them keep some of what they have become attached to.<br /><br />After 5 months of constant use, our binky is starting to tear where it is stitched to the animal. Honestly, this does not concern me at all given the fact that we use it all the time. If I only need one binky every 5-6 months, I'm one happy mama!",12/2/2014

Before buying this item, I wasn't sure if it would be worth the extra money for these pacifiers vs. the plain Avent Soothies but I think it is well worth the extra money.

His mother and father were so surprised to see him actually reach for this little pacifier and put it in his mouth himself. He wont let ho of it. They love it too because they don't have to worry about him spitting it out or dropping the pacifier to the floor so much. The weight of the little stuffed animal, even though it is really light, does keep the pacifier near or on the baby when he lets go.

Let me tell you why...<br /><br />1) They don't roll when they are dropped (or thrown)<br />2) They are a much more recognizable and grab-able when you are digging in a diaper bag or retrieving it from where it was thrown in your car<br />3) They have the same pacifier as what we were given in the hospital<br />4) They come in a variety of animals so you can get one that matches your baby's personality<br />5) They last a long time<br />6) They are easier to find in the dark than a pacifier alone<br />7) Your baby will be able to hold this and put it in his/her own mouth much sooner than a pacifier alone<br />8) Your baby will enjoy being soothed by the pacifier, but also enjoy carrying it around like a lovie<br />9) They are easy to wash - either by hand with soap and water, or throw them in with your laundry<br />10) They are very affordable considering how long they last and the preference your baby will show towards it<br /><br />Babies are funny - they seem to have a preference for one pacifier over another. We tried offering several brands of pacifiers to the boys as we were given some as shower gifts. My boys (twins) refused them, and were only soothed by their Soothie pacifiers. However, every time we went out, if a pacifier was dropped, it was a scramble to locate it. One of ours ended up rolling under all of the pews at church and landed in front of the alter. That was embarrassing!<br /><br />We own the frog, turtle, brown puppy, and monkey. I initially purchased the frog and turtle around when my twins were 4 months and it hasn't been until recently that they've shown much wear. I think since my guys are teething now, they tend to chew and pull their pacifiers while biting them, causing the material the Soothie pacifiers are made of to tear. I always make sure to check the pacifiers for tears before giving them to my boys because I wouldn't want any part of the pacifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do. I simply used my seam ripper to snip the threads holding the pacifier in the animals' mouths and hand sewed a new pacifier in. I do have sewing experience so this was easy for me to do. I used cotton wrapped poly thread for strength and durability and a very sharp needle. The Soothie pacifier was not difficult to sew through at all - I didn't even need a thimble.<br /><br />When you think about the fact that this is the pacifier your child will want over other pacifiers, that it will be a soothing thing to suck on AND be a soft thing to cuddle with, and that the life of this pacifier will probably be about 12 months, suddenly spending 12-20 on it doesn't seem so bad. Especially if you or a friends can sew a new pacifier into the mouth if ever needed.<br /><br />The only cons about this product is that I worry about germs getting trapped in the material. We inspect ours daily for grime and goo (and tears) and we wash them regularly. Also, as mentioned, we got to the point where the pacifiers were showing wear and tear and one of the pacifiers started ripping at the nipple. I am so glad I caught that before my child swallowed it on accident. This could happen with any pacifier though! Just make sure to wash regularly and always inspect the pacifier before giving it to your child.ifier to break off and be swallowed.<br /><br />I have had to replace the pacifier on both the frog and the turtle recently (so about 12 months after purchase) but it was easy to do.

They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animals for boys & girls!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning",10/8/2013

I didn't buy another one for him but I gave him a little teether just to keep something in his mouth when he gets fussy.

It's been great not to have to worry as much about pacis falling on the floor.  This one is really cute and one of our favorites.

It's just heavy enough to stay in place so you aren't constantly having to put the paci back in your infant's mouth.  Then, when your baby is old enough they can hold on to the wubbanub's ears or paws and put it in their mouth all by themselves.  Great for them to carry around when they are older and most importantly the paci is big enough that when dropped it never rolls away - we never lost one!  We bought three.  toss in washer.

My boy's only 6 weeks old and hasn't really gotten a grasp of holding onto things yet, but when we gave it to him, he seemed to really like it.  He already liked the SOOTHIE pacifiers so it wasn't a big deal.  I think as he gets a little older, he'll be able to hold onto the puppy better, but we think it was good for him to get a headstart and start holding onto it now.  Even when it falls out of his mouth, I like the fact that it doesn't go very far.  Sometimes he has a tendency to spit out his pacifier pretty far!      My only dislike is that you can't detach it (like with the Paci Plushies) so you could wash them separately.",5/8/2010

First, at 8 weeks, she can grab on to the puppy, helping to keep the paci in place.  Second, the puppy has saved the paci part from many falls (no 5 second rule needed).  Third, the dog sits on my daughter's chest while in her chair or in bed, so if she spits out the paci, it doesn't go far (and she is often able to retrieve it on her own).  Fourth, it's much harder to lose the paci when there is an adorable puppy attached.  The price is reasonable; the construction is very durable; and the dog is doggone cute.  This is our second  kid and our second round with Wubbanub infant pacifiers (animal + paci); they have a great selection and create a truly reliable product.",9/18/2009

That being said, my baby loves her soothies, this is easy to find if it falls or is dark, and it's cute. It seems to keep the paci in her mouth a little better. It minorly interferes with breastfeeding; if my baby suckles on this a long time, she'll chew on my nipple a couple times before latching like normal, so wait to introduce this until the baby is a pro at latching. Overall, I am happy to have this, but if something happens to mine, I may just sew my own.",8/28/2014

It didn't work very well at first because it wasn't heavy enough to stay on baby's chest when he wiggles (all the time!) but is heavy enough to pull the pacifier out of his mouth when it falls off his chest. But at 7-weeks old he's now able to control his head movement more and is at least able to turn back to the pacifier. Hopefully soon he'll be able to snuggle with it like other buyers describe & it will be even better. He does like the shape of the nipple though.,8/19/2014

I properly sterilized and cleaned the paci before giving to my baby, just as the instructions indicated, but no matter what I did, I couldn't avoid the bad rubber odor. I couldn't figure out why she hated these so much, until I put it to my mouth and realized it smelled SO strong. Moreover, they get sticky really quickly, too. A lot of reviewers mentioned that they get sticky only when it's time to replace thm, but all three of ours got sticky only after 1-2 days of use.

I gave him one as he was getting ready to head down for his next nap.  It took a little work to get him to hang onto it, as he's been used to more traditionally shaped pacifiers (he's 11 weeks old), but he caught on fairly fast, and the next time he went to nurse I noticed that he was taking a deeper latch already!  I had some supply problems early on, so anything that encourages good latching and better milk transfer is okay by me.    I've noticed some reviews criticizing this pacifier for being a potential choking hazard.  Let me say that there is a degree of personal responsibility here.  These are not the hard plastic pacifiers most people are used to... they are medical grade silicone, made for newborns.  The whole thing is softer, more flexible, and yes, that means that you have to watch your baby to make sure he can't fit the whole thing into his mouth, because babies try that.  On the wrapper it says not to leave your baby alone with a pacifier (any pacifier), and I imagine that it's for precisely this reason.  If your child can fit the whole Soothie into his/her mouth, it's too small and you need to buy a binky that is appropriately sized for your child.    As for the suckerfish look...

I purchased this about a month ago and my baby loved it.  My baby is a newborn, so obviously he's not chewing on it or doing anything crazy to damage it.  There is a semi-hard piece of plastic in the inside of this pacifier, and I guess the sucking motion itself caused the hard plastic to cut its way through the soft plastic.

I have bought a lot of specialty baby items because they were supposed to be amazing and help their child develop and make parenting easier.  Most of the items I have gotten just sit in a box after being examined by the baby once and then tossed away in a fit of indifference.<br /><br />One thing that my baby has loved since day 2 has been a pacifier.  She is a big pacifier baby.  I learned quickly that even though young babies can't control their movements and can't throw things, a pacifier that just falls out of their mouth still has the ability to roll far enough away to never be found again.<br /><br />Wubbanubs actually solve this problem.  When a pacifier falls, it can't go far.  If it is thrown, it is easily found.  And when babies start being able to control their hands, they can grasp the stuffed animal and bring it to their mouth much earlier than they would be able to with just a normal pacifier.",11/25/2014

And both our boys preferred this type of pacifier. But now our son is 18mos and it has become like a security lovie. Other than falling asleep, he doesn't need it often, but it sure makes him feel better to have this along.

To wash the dragon, I've just used a damp cloth with some dish detergent and let him air dry.  It has worn just fine cleaning him with this method.  Just a reminder, the soothie is stitched to the dragon, so you cannot change out the pacifier, unless you feel comfortable sewing and are crafty.  I feel like for the money the dragon costs, I'd be too afraid to botch the job! Overall, I think it's an adorable novelty, but not incredibly useful.

13016070,R3VJTSZC4H5VGW,869431526,2,4,5,N,So Happy With Our Newest Friend.,"My son must have about 25 of these guys by now. He loves them all, but I wouldn't say equally. He has some he likes for bed, others for play, and a very few are loved so greatly they can do both. But this little bunny with her bright colors and fancy ears manages to be welcome in both his crib, or his stroller. Fancy that.<br /><br />This pacifier is the same amazing quality as all the others we've received. I'm sure &#34;Cora&#34; will be with us long after the pacifier has met it's end. I like the notion that giving up the pacifier when it's time will be a smoother transition since he can keep half of it. And really I think it's the half he loves most. We bought a mini pack in play and he doesn't like anything but his special wubanubs going in there. He puts them in, pets their back, and says &#34;Oh, babies&#34;. In fact the first time he said baby was when he was talking to his special friends, they're his babies. :)<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br />After using this pacifier for a short while the decorative stitching on her face has started to come undone. Her nose has almost completely unraveled. I have never had the problem with wubbanubs but this is upsetting. There needs to be better quality control, this is a baby toy. I bought my son the pink bunny for his Easter basket and I'm going to have to really check it over before giving it to him. He was so sad when his purple one &#34;got hurt&#34; and I'm pretty mad he was distressed by something so avoidable.<br /><br />*SECOND UPDATE*<br />As I mentioned above we bought this in both pink and purple. While the pink seemed solid at first the stitching on her nose started to unravel as well. We own close to 30 of these and these two are only ones to have issues like this (we had a penguin that came with a ripped pacifier but that's a different issue). Clearly the quality of this particular style is lacking. To have both come apart in the exact same way is really disappointing. I've fixed both noses myself but I should never have had to do that. For this reason I'm bringing this down to 2 stars down from my usual 5 for all my other wubbanub reviews.I'm bringing this down to 2 stars down from my usual 5 for all my other wubbanub reviews.",2/21/2014

They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />We love all 3 of these cute animals! The giraffe has cute sewn bubbles in different colors on her, the kitten is nice bright hot pink, and the safari puppy has a cute leopard print underside & knotted tail.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animals for girls ~ all made of pink!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning",10/8/2013

Beautiful sleep... you start to dream and BAM! The baby lets out a cry and you look at the clock. Letting out a groan you roll out of bed and stumble to the baby. The baby is still asleep but that won't last long if you can't locate the pacifier. Thank goodness you thought to buy a MAM Night Glow pacifier. Instead blindly feeling around the bed... then crawling around the floor hoping you can find it in time... You spot the pacifier immediately, pop it into baby's mouth and he/she makes that classic Maggie Simpson sucking noise. Silently you tip-toe back to bed and hope it lasts...<br /><br />Bottom line: Even if it's been hours since the pacifier has been exposed to light, it still emits a decent glow so you can locate it in the darkest of rooms.

This offers a great distraction from being away from mom in the back seat. We use the Nuk pacifiers with the handles and they stay in securely. I also used the teether toys which are cute but heavy. I tried to do one teether toy and one nuk but the teether toy made one side too heavy and didn't work well. Either way she likes the teethers on their own. The materials used are soft and the toy itself seems of high quality. The cow design is so cute! My one concern might be that the pulley system have a bit more tension to avoid sliding while my daughter has the pacifier in her mouth. It is hardly a problem but I could see how it might be an issue if you had a younger, less strong baby to pull it down and keep it in her mouth. My pediatrician even thought the toy was a great idea at her last checkup! Baby girl loves this thing I it has really helped cease the screaming in the car.

10664358,R3JIQABUZUGG85,911821018,4,1,1,N,It's so small! Love it!,"This arrived in the mail yesterday - My daughter is due in 5 weeks and I've read so many great reviews on these little things that I just had to buy one for her. When it came I was surprised at how SMALL it really is!<br /><br />When you look at photos of other people's photos of their babies holding these they look pretty decent in size, like this would be something that baby could use as a stuffed animal in a year or so, once they are off a pacifier. We ordered the lamb one, and with the pacifier off of it (It'll just take a few scissor snips to take it off), it looks like it could be a toy for a dog!<br /><br />It's so darn cute and tiny though... My 8lb poodle saw it come out of the bag an immediately sat in front of me, thinking it was a new toy for her. We've put it in the nursery and now she sits at the door waiting to go in so she can try and find it. (haha!) I will update this after baby arrives and we have a chance to use it, but I am hopeful that it will be a big success!<br /><br />UPDATE 9/14/12<br /><br />My daughter is 7 weeks now and she loves this thing. We recently took it on a trip to CA, and I make sure it's always in her diaper bag when we leave the house. We also have the blue bear one of these that stays at home as well. It's been great to keep it in her mouth when sleeping (she's a tummy sleeper), and when in the baby carrier, I don't have to worry about her dropping it and losing it in the carrier!<br /><br />Also - Our cousin has about 9 of these ones for his son, and they love them as well!",6/28/2012

She is almost 6 months & this was the last one I got for her at 5 months. She LOVES it and never really took a pacifier until these. She loves to put the animal in her mouth too & she chews on it. Many people think they're a pain because you can't clean them but I throw them in the washing machine all the time with her laundry. I don't put it in the dryer...I just let it air dry.",4/8/2012
25473507,RDGA62PAARPJ2,911821018,2,6,9,N,Didn't end up working out,"Okay, so on the cute-factor scale these things are a clear 5 stars.  The little lamb (and it is little) is precious and you can't help but say awww when you first see it.  It's a great concept, and any parent that has played the retrieve the binky game is hoping it will work.  So far for us it's been about 50% successful.  The little lamb's feet are slightly weighted, so if our daughter is lying still in her rumble chair and you get the binky in her mouth and the lamb spread out right it does work.  The problem is at 11 weeks she's not exactly lying still all that often but she doesn't have the hand control to hold on to the lamb.  She still has the whole arms-swinging-wildly startle reflex going, so more often than not she knocks the lamb, which pops the binky out of her mouth, defeating the whole purpose.  She can't control her hands enough yet to then get it back in.<br /><br />On the upside, it does prevent the binky from rolling off onto the floor and it makes it much easier to find and put back in her mouth.  I can see the potential for this product and hope when she gets older and can actually hold on to the lamb it will work.  I'm giving it a 3 star rating for now for cuteness and potential and hope to upgrade to a 4 or 5 star rating in the future.<br /><br />Update: A year later and I'm afraid this little lamb never really worked out for us.  By the time my daughter had enough hand control to no knock the lamb out she was keeping a binky in her mouth more readily and she would grab this little guy to examine and again, pull the binky out of her mouth.  We ended up using binky leashes, which were perfect for our needs.  She recently rediscovered this little guy, and while she's too big to need him, she did enjoy popping the binky in and out of her mouth a few times holding the lamb, but then became angry that the lamb wouldn't give up his prize. =)  At this point, this guy is holding on to one star from us for sheer cuteness and one for what COULD be a great idea for another child, but I'm afraid he never quite worked out for us.  (We have friends who swear by him however, so it may work for your child.)<br /><br />As a note: it would be nice if there was some way to attach and detach the binky.  If she had used this frequently I could see it getting dirty and needing to be washed, which would be tricky without getting laundry detergent on the binky.  On the reverse side, you would want to wash the binky with dish soap but not the lamb.  The only decent solution is to handwash, and what busy parent has time for that?  (Plus at my daughter's current age I could see her loving to carry this little guy around if she could get the binky out of his mouth and it would have been nice to have given the toy a second life.)",12/31/2011

My baby is actually a Nuk fan, but she will take the Soothie from time to time, especially when her sweet lamb is attached!  It has been a great way to help her keep the pacifier in her mouth, and she loves to hold the lamb while it's on her chest.  I'm just so disappointed that the lamb is currently unavailable.  I've searched several times for it for recently born babies, but no luck.  We haven't had any issues with the pacifier falling off, or the lamb getting dirty.

32676187,R4DA7XILJ3A69,911821018,5,0,0,N,A MUST BUY ITEM!,"This most adorable lamb has made giving a pacifier to a reluctant baby much easier. Our baby is exclusively breastfed (and only took to a pacifier for about 1-2 mths, and then said, no, thank you, in the form of WAAHHs!) so the pacifier isn't mommy, but this Wubbanub seems to help calm her down when I am not able to get to her (i.e. while she is in the carseat). She has even put herself to sleep with it in the car seat and the stroller. The lamb can rest comfortably on her chest while she finds the nipple herself, instead of me putting/holding a pacifier to her mouth (which would also annoy me if I were her). As others have stated, it would be great to be able to detach the pacifier from the Wubbanub, but oh well, it is still a must buy item. You will fall in love with this lamb. I even named it. :-D",5/18/2011
22918284,R3L3JESPEFOKLR,911821018,5,0,0,N,"Love this item, so cute!","This is such an adorable pacifier and has great features too.  One of the best parts about this pacifier is that I do not have to attach it to a string pacifier holder (which could get wrapped around my little one), I would simply just rest it on him and he would push at it if he wanted it.  This sweet little animal is light weight yet heavy enough to stay put in a carseat or while he sleeps in his bassinet.  This product is great, I have had it for my child since he was born, I gave it to him about 4-5 days in as a newborn (which I have come to realize is the best time to give a pacifier to a newborn, it is not too early for nipple confusion and not too late that they refuse it).  He has been able to grasp at it from day one.  He was able to push the little animal back in if it started to fall out or push it out if he did not want it.  The design makes it easier to stay in their mouths when they are so little and are learning to suck.     It is also easy to wash and it drys quickly.  I recommend two so that you can always have one ready to go.    I did see a few other wubbanub pacifiers on sale at Babies'R'us, but when my friend purchased hers I noticed that the quality was not as good, they were much more flimsy and very light weight, making it hard to stay put.   When I was still pregnant I wrote...I love this product, it is so precious and this is the best price I have seen for these.  My friends baby has them and loves them so much, she is able to grab it at put it back in her mouth herself.  I am still pregnant and hoping that my baby will love them as much as my friends baby did.  I love how soft they are and they are a good size, not too large and not too small.  Gotta love the sweet white lamb.",3/8/2011

They are the only pacifiers she has ever taken. It's also the kind they gave her while she was in the NICU at the hospital. I am so glad someone came up with this idea!<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Cute animals for boys & girls!<br />2. Easy to keep track of - easy to see in a dark bedroom at night & also when you are holding the baby, they are much easier to grab as they are falling than a Paci alone<br />3. Stays in better than a Soothie Paci by itself - we often prop the animal on her chest and she seems to love holding on to the soft stuffed animal & can even sometimes push it back into her own mouth (and she's only 10 weeks!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Tedious cleaning - I usually wash them on gentle in the washing machine but worry about my daughter ingesting detergent residue so I usually then wash off the pacifier top with a pacifier wipe<br />2. Falls out - not as much as when it's only the pacifier - could just be my daughters tongue pushing it out or something but I think worth mentioning",10/8/2013

18364219,R2BK466K2R9P7B,925732558,5,10,11,N,"Great Pacifier, Cute Toy","We love our Wubbies! I originally got the elephant and the giraffe as baby gifts when my son was first born. We have since added the cat, dragon, and owl to our collection and have them stationed around the house and in the diaper bag. My son likes all the animals, but the Owl is by far his favorite. He loves to look at Wubby's eyes and now that he's old enough to hold onto it, he carries it around everywhere. I feel like the Wubbanubs are a good way to start working on hand control and dexterity and my husband loves them because they are easier to catch than just the pacifier when they fall/get tossed. As for cleaning, we give our Wubbies a bath several times a week by putting the pacifier end in boiling water (we call it the Wubby watering hole). I've also washed all our Wubbies multiple times using a garment bag and they do really well (our giraffe popped a seam in the wash, but it was easy to sew back up). To rank all the Wubbanubs we have:<br />1.Owl: Our favorite Wubby. Before he could hold onto it, my son could hug it making it the easiest Wubby to carry around since I didn't have to hold it. The eyes are like magic, my son loves to look at the owl's eyes. Now that he's teething, he also likes to chew Wubby's feet and the edge of the pacifier. It has done great in the wash and will be a great little stuffed toy when we are done with the pacifier.<br />2.Giraffe: This was the first Wubbanub we got and I think it's great for little babies since it's light and thin. My son seems to like the contrasting colors and when he was just learning to grasp things, the giraffe was easiest because it has the two horns a thin neck and a tail to hang onto. It's also very cute and is our second favorite.<br />3. Dragon: The dragon has fun colors (red/blue/orange) and is chunky like the owl so it's easy for little ones to hang onto. The body is thick, but the wings are easy for little hands to grab. Not my son's favorite, but it's pretty cute.<br />4. Cat: Cute colors, and myson likes the kitties feet. It's nothing too exciting, we use it as the back-up most of the time.<br />5. Elephant: Also a chunkier Wubbanub. It hasn't been our favorite, but as my son gets older he's liking it more and more. When we first got it we rarely used it just because it was really big for a tiny baby. At three months old, my son is starting to pay more attention to the elephant's ears and can hang onto its body so we're using it more and more.",8/15/2014

38958742,R2B4Y2YDSV712M,93126241,5,6,7,N,Favorite pacifier by far!,"My husband and I were given two orange newborn GumDrop pacifiers in the hospital and found that our daughter took to them quickly as she needed the additional suckling time and I couldn't be her permanent pacifier.  Before we found that our daughter prefers the GumDrop, we tried the following pacifiers (because we received a ton at my baby showers):   1) Philips Avent Soothie Pacifier - look similar to GumDrop, but doesn't have the nook cutout around the nose  2) NUK latex pacifier and the Nuk silicone - have the angled tip upwards  3) various MAM pacifiers - shorter oval sized stem and silicone  4) Dr. Brown's orthodontic pacifier - angled tip upwards    Our daughter preferred silicone to latex and wasn't picky at first, but once she hit 6 months, she wouldn't take any of the others than her GumDrop!  We don't give out 5 stars easily unless we really love something, but these GumDrop pacifiers are the best.  One thing to note - I wasn't sure what the difference was between the newborn vs. full-term GumDrop pacifier - newborn was what we received in the hospital on the package but it said full-term on the ones we ordered here on Amazon.  From what we can tell, we believe the only difference is the thickness/consistency of the silicone.  The newborn ones appear to be a little thinner/softer type of silicone and the full-term ones are a little thicker/sturdier perhaps since they chew harder especially now that there are teeth!  There is no difference in the length of the stem or the overall shape of the pacifier.  We purchased the natural scent as we thought that was safest and we just make sure to wash them often so they don't get the plastic type of smell pacifiers sometimes carry.  But next time we may try to order the vanilla scent just to see what the difference may be.    Pros:   - Love the nose cut-out because they can breathe easily without interference and it is made to conform to their face comfortable - not like the Soothie that takes up their whole face!- Hole for stem is easy for her to put her finger through when she wants to chew on something with some substance  - Medical-grade silicon -> dishwasher safe  - One piece of silicone is easy to clean and doesn't collect in hard-to-reach crevices  - Soft and pliable -> no nipple confusion when breastfeeding  - Firm enough that your little one can chew away but lightweight  - Hole that you can loop a pacifier strap through it to attach to their clothes  - Available in four colors: pink, purple, orange and blue    Cons: NONE!*  *One we received from the hospital recently cracked (after 7.5 months of use) as she liked to chew on all sides of them now that she can grab them herself and she was bending them backwards (against the way they are made to fit smoothly against their face).  I tried giving her one of the others we had until I could order some GumDrops and she put them in her mouth, immediately pulled them out and laid them on the ground all in a matter of two seconds.  That's why I think the full-term are helpful because it's a sturdier silicone likely better equipped for older babies/toddlers.    Just recently we saw [[ASIN:B004IOHN8Q The First Years 2 Pack GumDrop Infant Pacifier, Pink/Purple]] are now sold at Target and they have the same shape and appear to be almost identical to these but these also are offered in one more color, green.  I did buy some just to see if they were different and I noticed the difference in the thickness of the silicone in these much clearer than the ones on Amazon.  The First Years 0-3 months version is softer/thinner/more pliable than the 3+ months version which is a thicker/sturdier silicone.  The best price is still on Amazon, but still a good back up if you're ever in a bind.",7/8/2011

The Soothie blocks their nose and it doesn't seem to stay in their mouth very well because it isn't contoured to their face. I found this Gumdrop one on Amazon and she switched over right away, no problems. I think it stays in better and makes breathing easier (or maybe it just makes me breathe easier not seeing her little nose blocked). It also has a hole for a binky holder, which is great. Another good point is that it is all one piece for safety, and I don't know how my daughter always falls asleep with the binky wedged between her face and the bed, but with the Gumdrop it's not uncomfortable because it doesn't have the hard plastic piece.

We had problems with dirt collecting in the seal or soapy water getting stuck in the nipple of other pacifiers.  With Gumdrop, dirt or germs have no where to collect and hide.    2.  Medical-grade silicon means we can boil the pacifiers to sterilize them or run them through the dishwasher.    3.  Soft nipple that my baby loves.    4.  Firm frame that my baby loves to teeth on constantly, but it's not too hard for her little teeth and gums.    5.  Durability!!!  I wish every product was as durable as these pacifiers!  We've been using them 24/7 for 10 months and they are still in perfect condition.  I check them regularly for wear since she chews so hard on them and we treat them pretty rough, but so far they're perfect!    6.  BPA safe.  Yes, they are.  The center frame is not BPA free, however, it is completely covered by the medical-grade silicone so the baby is never in contact with the center frame.  You shouldn't use it IF the silicone layer becomes compromised, obviously.  (Perhaps if you ran them over with a car, the silicone layer would be compromised.  Otherwise, it holds up amazingly well.)    7.  The cut-out for the nose seems like a little thing, but it's a big thing to my baby.  This is the only one-piece pacifier with the nose cut-out that I could find.    8.  Little hole for a binky strap to loop through, which is critical for us.

51741745,R31177OCQ3C5AC,93126241,5,1,3,N,Now they are BPA free!!!!!,"old review:  I bought these because my baby likes soothie pacifiers and I thought these were cuter.  As I read the packaging I saw they have a polycarbonate base surrounded by silicone.   BPA is used to make polycarbonate.  The BPA is surrounded by silicone, but if the silicone barrier fails you are giving your baby BPA to suck on.  I did notice the packaging very carefully says pthalate and latex free, but no mention of BPA because it is not BPA free.  Too bad because I do like them better than the soothies, but for me it's just not worth even the potential risk of spending a good part of the day sucking on BPA.  edited to add:  I noticed that they are now listed as BPA free on the website and emailed them.  They sent me back a note that they made a change to the internal guard last year and no longer sell the ones with polycarbonate!  I found that very very reassuring and would now happily use them.

Since I paid so much for this, I wanted very much for my newborn to take to it. Turns out, he prefers, if at all, the Avent air flow (also available for purchase on Amazon). Truth is, my six-week-old just isn't the pacifier-loving kid my first born was. So, I suppose it would have been good to try two years ago! I would suggest trying this one though (I'm a dental assistant, and would recommend you ALWAYS try the orthodontic pacifier before you pop the soothie in your infants' mouth). $9 or$10 is a small price to pay to avoid thousands of dollars in orthodontic bills in their teenage years!

17884615,R31ZXFAS0W6GQ1,955350284,5,9,9,N,Best pacifier choice out there!,"LOVE these pacifiers!  We bought small packs of three different types of pacifiers to see what our baby would prefer.  We bought Dr Brown's Prevent, Nuk, and Avent.  Our baby will LOVES the Dr Brown pacifiers.  She'll put up with the Avent ones, but they pop out of her mouth so easily it's hardly worth it.  The Nuk ones get spit out almost instantly, they're too hard to keep in her mouth.  These ones have a fantastic shape that is very well designed.  I love that it doesn't give her gas because she's not sucking any air.  These are just so perfectly designed and we've already bought more for her.  I think it's good advice to try different pacifiers for your baby because all babies are different, but I will say that these ones definitely stay in their mouths better no matter who your baby is - so I won't tell you not to try different pacifiers at first, but definitely include these when you're trying a few out!  They'll probably become a quick favorite for you and baby.<br /><br />Originally we purchased the Dr Browns Prevent pacifiers from another Amazon listing where Colors may vary and there are no handles on the pacifier.  We ended up with blue and red, which I didn't love for our little girl.  It's silly and not important, but I didn't love having her suck on a blue or red pacifier when she was always dressed in pink or purple.  These pacifiers are much preferred!  Though they're the same shape for sucking, there are a few differences.  The silly difference (but it matters to me!) of the color is the obvious difference.  Another key difference is these ones also have the handles on them and the others don't.  I have found that I much prefer the handles for multiple reasons.  One, they are easy to hold if I'm burping her and just want to have the pacifier handy for when she's done and ready for it.  Two, if I drop the pacifier, the extra weight from the handle makes it land on the back almost every time so the nipple doesn't get dirty.  Three, if you're attaching a pacifier clip, it can attach to the handle instead of the opening on the part of the pacifier that touches the baby's face.  Our pacifier clip was always rubbing against our baby's face when using the other ones and I didn't like that since it left a red mark on her cheek.<br />Another difference is that these pacifiers actually come with a clip-on nipple cover.  I LOVE this accessory because if I'm running to a neighbor's house for a short visit and I don't need to tote a whole diaper bag, but I do want to bring a pacifier - I easily can with the clip cover.  It works so great to just clip the cover on so I can throw the pacifier in my pocket without it getting all nasty.  Or it's nice for putting in the diaper bag without getting gross as well.<br /><br />The price is about the same (within a dollar) of the other colors may vary listing, so these ones are the clear winner between the two listings.  If you want a great pacifier for your little girl, these are PERFECT!",4/9/2013

I have regular pacifiers with the plastic shield and Avent Soothies, and the Soothies were the only ones where I could cram two of them in there.  For regular pacifiers with the plastic shield you can only fit one.  That's not such a problem for me, but the description really should be a bit more accurate.  The pacifiers I have are the newborn size, so if you get a bigger pacifier there's even less space for it.  On the plus side, it does seem to lock pretty well.  I did have trouble opening it from the tab at the top; a work around it so just squeeze the sides and it pops right open.  It has an open side on the clip, which allows you to easily attach it to something.  I also bought the Nuby carrier, and it's pretty much the same thing (though quite a bit cheaper).  Size wise, it also only fits one pacifier so if you're looking for something to fit two pacifiers, you will need to keep looking (or just use a Ziploc bag).",6/26/2013

23388096,R295QEUGN5QR5C,984679751,5,0,0,N,A Lifesaver!,"I fought the idea of a pacifier for my second son, but he was colicky and we resorted to any method possible to stop the screaming. He became attached to the Soothie brand pacifier we were given at the hospital. When he was around 2 months, we began the battle of him losing his pacifier in the night and I was constantly waking up to put it back in his mouth. I had been skeptical about trying a Wubbanub because I was afraid he would form an attachment to it since it's a toy and a Soothie in one and that it would be hard to break him of it. In a state of sleep deprivation, I picked this one up and am so glad I did!<br /><br />When he was still small, I swaddled this up with him and night so that he didn't lose it. Did it make him sleep through the night? No. But at least I wasn't constantly retrieving a pacifier. As he got older, he learned to hold it himself and guide it back in his mouth. The longhorn attached made it easier for his immature eye-hand coordination than if it was just the pacifier. Now that he's 8 months old, he chews on the horns, sucks on the tag, and chews on the pacifier. I don't have bumper pads in his crib, so other pacifiers fall through the rail. This Wubbanub stays in the crib much better than those do.<br /><br />I've read reviews that say it's cheaply made or not easily washable and I do not agree. About once a week I round up all the pacifiers and boil them. I just hold the nipple of this into the boiling water to keep the longhorn dry. Rather than throwing it in the washing machine with clothes when the longhorn gets dirty (and it does a lot because it goes everywhere with us), I just hand wash it with some Dreft and let it air dry. This keep it from getting fuzzy, as other reviewers have mentioned.<br /><br />I had actually gotten on here to order a second one because we like it so much and I'm afraid we'll lose the one we have. My fear came true that this has become his lovey, but I plan to just cut the pacifier off when the time comesto wean off of it. I still wish he didn't use a pacifier, but I'm so happy that we found something he likes and is capable of using all on his own!<br /><br />UPDATED JULY 2013<br /><br />I still fully stand behind this product, but wanted to update that we did have our first big issue with this Wubbanub. At 10 months, my son is a terror when it comes to teething. He bites and chews very hard on anything available, including this pacifier. On the one he's been using for 6 months, he was finally able to rip the pacifier part off of the longhorn by chomping down on the pacifier and pulling on the plush part over and over for weeks. It came off in one piece and wasn't a choking hazard, but it's thoroughly confused my son! I think part of the problem is that these are made with Soothies for ages 0-6 months, which has thinner material in the pacifier. If I had a way to attach a 6+ month paci to this, it would probably fare much better. Still a great product, but keep an eye out for your little chompers and make sure that the material is still holding firm.",5/14/2013

I discovered these and thought I'd give them a try.  They worked like a charm.  He has never had an issue keeping these in his mouth because there is nothing pushing against his nose when he sucks, and because of the contoured shape.

The sheep could be in any position and it'll stay in his mouth. Not with this one. But my 4 month old loves the bright colors of it. He has also started playing with the duck and the sheep now that he's getting older and discovering textures more and more. Like my review of the sheep I would say besides the odd positioning of the pacifier due to the beak, my only other grievance is that the pacifiers aren't removable.

10729014,R21V50R74AWVHX,997127233,4,0,0,N,Good for small hands.,The duck is very cute and my baby likes the colors.  Also it is easy for her to grab and she likes to feel it.  I like that the wings and feet are weighted so that it stays in place better.  The only down side is that it is cumbersome when she is upset and I am trying to get her to take her pacifier.,5/18/2010

14725658,rmy5m7low7xcs,998397375,4,0,0,n,great while applying makeup!,"i mainly use this hands-free pump bra when i want to save time while doing my makeup. it's easy to put on and re-size, comfortable, and holds the pump very sturdy. i would probably use it more often except i need to sometimes squeeze by breasts to get more milk flow and this being on prevents me from doing that. also, sometimes i'm just too lazy to put it on. but for the right price, it's great to have when you want to be doing something while pumping and are trying to be efficient or are just too tired to sit there and hold the pump bottles. have used it a moderate amount since purchased and i'm glad i got it. only wish i purchased it earlier, like in the first month or two after giving birth when i was much more exhausted to pump. overall, great product!",8/5/2013
30491636,r15sw758l31fb7,998397375,4,0,0,n,great pumping bra but not comfortable as regular bra,"i am planning in just wearing this bra all day so i don't need to switch back and forth at work to pump, but it is not very comfortable and looks bad under tighter clothes. luckily i wear scrubs so that shouldn't be a problem. it adjusts to fit many sizes! i usually wear a size 38dd and the xs/sm/med fits great with room to spare. i would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to pump hands free. should work with all pumps (i have a medela)",4/14/2013
