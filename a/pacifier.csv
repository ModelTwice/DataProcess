But when the screaming constantly got to be too much, I decided to give this one a try.  Heaven!  She only sucks it for brief periods until she calms down and when she's done, she is DONE, she spits it out with a disgusted look on her face that is too funny.  But it has caused no nipple confusion and it does what it's intended purpose is, stopping the screaming.  Highly recommend!",7/20/2011

41665012,RT7KLBKZJ9XH0,122950606,4,0,0,N,Great for baby,I was glad to find these on amazon.  I only had the 1 I purchased from the hospital and they were a little pricey.  My baby doesn't take this all the time and I'm glad with him being breastfed.  We did go through a few days of nipple confusion but then we were able to settle in to a feeding routine and he is back to being breastfed full time.  He takes this when he's sleepy after a meal and won't burp.  I'm glad they have these and they're supposed to be the closest thing to the mother's nipple.,2/15/2011

I am nursing him and he seems to like the softer nipples.,2/14/2011

My daughter is 9 months and still takes these at bedtime and naps. We tried the 3 months+ of these same binkies, and they are so thick and hard, she was not even interested on trying to suck it. They are easy to grab, so babies can put them back in their mouths by themselves once they get the hand-mouth coordination. They can be attached to a binkie holder that has a thin ribbon as the attachment point- just pull it through the hole and loop it over. They are inexpensive, so you can stock up on them and not feel bad if one gets lost.",1/3/2011

My daughter was exclusively breastfed, and was not given a pacifier until she was about 2-3 months old.  while it did take some time for her to get used to the pacifier, this was the only one she would take.  Eventhough they say 0-3 months, she is now 6 months, and continues to use it.  She has had no nipple confusion, and eventhough I try to get her to take other pacifiers, she will only suck on these.  It is great because they really help her settle down for her naps, and doesn't need them at any other time during the day.",12/28/2010

They help her fall asleep or calm down. She spits out the avent pacifiers. You can attach a pacifier-keeper clip to them by detaching the ring that comes standard with the Mam brand and just threading the ribbon/velcro through one of the holes in the soothie. At one point, she preferred these pacifiers over the breast when she was fussy and we realized that she had nipple confusion. Now we use them more sparingly only when she's surely not hungry and they work like a charm.",1/29/2010

I wasn't entirely sure which color would arrive but these are the ones I wanted.<br />The shape is ideal because as a BF mom it's important that it be very similar in shape and size for an easy transition back and forth. Our babies were always very picky about the shape, each one taking to different kinds. The first child only took the nipples that were flat on one side, while the second preferred the ones which are not, but rather like these - round all the way around. They are also long enough that they can stay in easy but still bulbous. These are thinner at the base than they are at the tip, unlike the hospital issued ones which are the same size all the way from base to bulb. Those tend to pop straight out of the babies mouth where these stay in and are a more natural fit for them. They are the litle handles to attach to a ribbon holder so they stay within reach and being clear they will never chip or peel like some of the plastic ones. The silicone material is easy to clean and disinfect and I would definitely recommend these as a gift or necessity buy for another little one.<br />I purchased this set at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review and all opinions expressed are my own.",6/2/2015

This orthodontic pacifier is tasteless and odor-free silicone nipple that makes an easy transition between pacifier, breast, and bottle. I myself is a breastfeeding mom and I can say that this can make an easy transition from my breast to this pacifier.

I had read good things about adults using pacifiers for anxiety, and since I have self-esteem issues which are easily fixed by envious stares from others, I figured two birds, one diamond pacifier.    Since buying this diamond encrusted pacifier, my life has completely changed.  I am no longer anxious, and while in public sucking away on my bangin' new sparkle thang, I get A LOT of looks.  I sense people and children and maybe even their pets staring at me while I'm catwalking and glittering down the street, on the subway, in grocery stores, and at Chuck E Cheese where I make it a point to show up all the toddlers.    Have I made many bad choices in my life?  Absolutely.  But getting a $17,000 diamond encrusted pacifier is not one of them.  I suck and sleep soundly at the shelter where I'm now living, since this purchase has set me back some.  And Kim Kardashian tweeted me back when I sent to her a picture of it - (yah !!!) I have been touched by celebrity, and that has just added the entire cake to my diamond-dusted icing.    One star off for the diamonds that keep falling out - but I replace them with craft crystals from Michaels and no one's the wiser.",12/22/2014

I know that sounds bad but this is why.... Nipple confusion! These closely resemble mom's and also resemble how most breast milk bottles are shaped. I don't let my babies hold on to a pacifier too long anyway so the &#34;orthodontic&#34; aspect doesn't really apply. Even if you're formula feeding, most of the bottles like Avent, Gerber or even Medela and other popular brands of bottles are still shaped the same.<br />In the other reviews I read, I saw a lot of moms have a problem finding pacifier clips or holders that fit.<br />Here's a solution..!<br />I haven't found any that hold these except the ones specially designed for Soothies. They have some by Booginhead that have a loop you saddle tie through the holes on the base. I, personally, dont care for these the way they suggest to use them. The loop rubs against baby's face and sits right where their mouth is wet. Just makes for a chapped face waiting to happen. SO, my solution, I used my husbands drill and drilled a hole in the tab and looped a Booginhead through that. Im sure you could use anything to put the hold there. If you do this, make sure its a SMALL hole and its low enough down to the base you dont have to worry about it breaking.<br />There are also some by Bella Tunno or Ulububu that clips on the tab. These don't hold too well but I guess its personal preference if you want a clip that slips or a loop that can chap :D<br />Personally, I think Soothie should put a hole in the tab themselves. :) Problem solved!<br />So, long and short of it, I think these are the best!!",8/27/2015

The hospital gave it to me... it has to be good!&#34;  He said no they give them to you because they get them for free!  I was so mad!

My dentist told me to switch to MAM it is the only pacifier that will not affect the baby's teeth!  So i switched him over.  It took about a week or so but he finally took to it!  How I switched him over....he only gets his pacifier at nap and bedtime.  So as a treat I gave him the new MAM during the day.  He didn't love it right away but anything was better than nothing :) I always put both the old and new one in the bed with him.

44303685,R2HAQBZ57TWC3H,246038397,5,0,0,N,love this design,"I'm really glad I found these, because my two week old newborn has been in love with them ever since he got his first one in the hospital.<br /><br />I really do not understand the complaints about them not being orthopedic considering they're designed for 0-3 months and clearly state so. Where are these newborns sprouting teeth at 3 months old? The youngest baby I've ever seen with a tooth has been 5 months old. Generally bottle fed babies get them around 6 months, but breast fed babies can go as long as a year or more without them. So it seems kind of silly to be worrying about teeth at this stage. The style purpose is to replace fingers so breaking the sucking habit is a lot easier later down the road.<br /><br />I also will state the same thing here that I did on my Binky review about it staying in the babies mouth. It is meant to simulate a nipple, so you do have to ensure the baby has latched on to it securely before letting go. Otherwise yes, it's not going to stay in their mouth. You don't need a holder... As a mom that has breast fed two babies I assure you they are pros at maintaining a Hoover like suction that is near impossible to break and keeps what they want in their mouth there. If it falls out, the baby either doesn't want it or may have accidentally knocked it out/broken the suction with their hands. The latter can happen with ANY pacifier, and TBH this is one of the less likely models for them to do that to thanks to the lack of a handle.<br /><br />Furthermore, there's no air vents on a breast but somehow baby manages to breath. Could that be the reason they have those upturned pug like noses that give space for air while latched on to the breast? For the record, a doctor pointed this factor out to me in the hospital when a nurse changed our position for feeding reasoning that the baby could not breath in a more natural position. Doc said that was nonsense and that's why babies have the noses they do.<br /><br />Moving on... The things I really appreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap. Always a good thing when it comes to pacifiers. You will lose them by the truck load no matter their design.<br />- As stated earlier, the lack of a handle makes it less likely baby will accidentally knock it out of their mouth.<br />- As someone else pointed out, the hollow tip can have a finger stuck in it to encourage better latching.<br />- They're so freaking cute in the baby's mouth, LOL.<br /><br />One thing I don't like:<br /><br />- The weird silicone piece sticking out of it. Seems the design would be better without it, as while it's more discrete than a handle it still can lead to the baby accidentally knocking it out of their mouth. I figure this is for some kind of accessory, but it's really annoying.ppreciate about this one compared to other nipple like designs like Binky:<br /><br />- The entire pacifier is silicone so if the baby falls asleep on it or it gets under them it doesn't cause them discomfort<br />- They're ridiculously cheap.

That is why it is one of the top pacifiers recommended by docs and hospitals.<br /><br />Even though my baby and I love this pacifier (it is the only one that we use) and I highliy recommend it, I do want think it is important to highlight some of the shortcomings/warnings that people should know about. But even with these problems, it is still the best option out there.<br /><br />Things you should know (but the pacifier is still worth it):<br />1) hard to hold: the little tiny tab on the back is really hard for a parent to find and hold. I have dropped this pacifier many times when trying to hold the little tab.<br />2) it is hard to clip: It is hard to find something to clip and keep this pacifier tied to baby. But that is the point. It is not recommended to stap the pacifier to baby because it is yet another item they can choke themselves with.<br />3) hard for baby to hold control: until baby is a bit older (3-6 months) and has better control of his/her hand, this pacifier is not easy for baby to hold and/or push back into the mouth. Other pacifiers have large handles or areas for small and uncontrolled hands to reach for and grab. Not this one.<br />4) CAUTION ABOUT SIZES: this is really important, and I only discovered this recently. There are two sizes (newborn 0-3 months) and (3+months). THe first size is much softer, the second size harder. It is important to change your baby to the larger size when they reach 3+ months because they start being able to bend the whole pacifier in the mouth and can even accidentally make the whole thing bend and fit in mouth! Super scary and dangerous. Though there are two small holes on either side of the pacifier that should allow baby to keep breathing if this were to happen, that gives me little comfort. The 3+ month size is much firmer and will prevent baby for bending and shoving the whole thing in mouth. So make sure you move to the second size!<br />* (theyhave also changed the way they package and label the sizes, to make everything more confusing! Before it was a newborn 0-3 month size, and then a 3/6month -18month size. Now the second size is simply labeled as 3+ months. Still the same pacifier, just new packaging to make sleep-deprived moms feel even more crazy....)",8/23/2012

The original maker of this design is The First Years, not Avent.  So when I saw this on the shelf, I was misled because Phillips Avent is making a pacifier which looks exactly like the green pacifier that First Years used to make.  This may not be a big deal to anyone else (or their baby), but my baby knew the difference & wanted nothing to do with the Avent brand paci.  When I compared the two, I noticed that the Avent brand paci was slightly harder than The First Years brand.  With The First Years, my baby could chomp down easier & get better suction too.  Our hospital gave out The First Years brand, and that is all my daughter will take now.  At 4 months old, this particular brand did not work for us, but that doesn't mean it won't work for you.  But if your baby is picky, I would stick to the original brand if you know that's what (s)he likes.<br /><br />Note: Though she always prefers her green First Years brand, now at 9 months, baby is accepting the Avent brand.<br /><br />UPDATE:  FIRST YEARS does not make this paci at all anymore.  It seems AVENT has the manufacturing  rights.<br />My original review of this product is a bit old.  I want to say that the green pacifiers have been great, and of all the ones on the market, this is the only one she will take... even if there was a small adjustment period when the new brand took over.  I think it's important to note that the 0-3 Months pacifiers are preferable to her because they are softer.  When I tried buying the paci for older babies, she spit it out & simply could not get good suction.  It seemed too hard & uncomfortable for her.  Anyway, at 18 months old, she was still using this green 0-3 month paci, and we will ween her off the paci soon.  Right now it's a great soother while she is teething, as nothing else works.

My son & daughter-in-law received several different kinds of pacifiers from friends and family.  The only one my grandson will use is the Munchkin.

I also appreciate that it's dishwasher safe.  I will definitely be buying the larger sizes as my grandson grows.  Wish I'd had these pacifiers for my own children.",9/20/2014

50930668,R2ORI051HPFOLA,277493012,4,2,2,Y,Best Binky is One That Suits Your Baby,"There are few things infants are more particular about than their binkies. Whether they’ll take one at all and, if so, what kind they like. It’s a different answer for every baby.<br /><br />These Munchkin models are lightweight and look well-designed for newborns up to about three or four months of age. They’re small and specially designed to allow them to get a good, comforting suck going, without blocking their nose. They also don’t have a handle, because they’re designed for infants too young to grasp on their own. I’ve found that if a parent puts their finger into the top of the nipple hole (from the opposite side), while the baby sucks, that can help encourage acceptance of a new paci in the very young. These are the perfect size for an adult pinky to slip into.<br /><br />They are listed as BPA-free on the packaging and can be washed in the dishwasher, which is very handy for sterilizing.<br /><br />As to whether YOUR newborn will love this particular style, it’s really hit or miss. With our (colicky) son we literally bought one of every pacifier from three different superstores and he wouldn’t take any of them. (Trust me, we would have given anything to find SOMETHING that soothed that kid.) Another child loved only the flat-ended types. (These Munchkin models have the longer, skinny nipples.) Some only like those green models most hospitals give out. Many infants also prefer a certain thickness or type of plastic and for the record, these are very squishy, thin silicone.<br /><br />As a mom, I’ll note that if you find one your baby finds comforting, buy a bunch so you’ll always have one handy.",9/15/2014
40581989,R3VB7NVLCSFD50,277493012,5,4,5,Y,The Perfect Newborn Pacifier,"I performed baby sitting duty with my newest grandchild this evening. I must say that this is a clever idea.......to actually create a pacifier for an infant's sweet and tiny little mouth. She latched onto this immediately and was very comfortable. The pacifier didn't obstruct her nose and before much time passed she fell asleep. When she woke up for her feeding she took to her bottle and was rocked in a cradle for a bit with the pacifier securely placed in her mouth.<br />I personally love the compact design and the quality materials used in this item. It doesn't have a funky rubbery smell and is easy to both clean and air dry. Great idea to put an infant at ease......a baby will take to this and isn't likely to drop this  as easily as a traditional nipple that is heavy, large, and cumbersome.",9/14/2014

29230018,R1EFC76K3XDAPC,343148814,2,65,69,N,Shocked that this was recommended for nursing babies...,"Let's talk about the form of the GumDrop nipple itself. I'm a mother of 6 children - nursed all of them. Our first child first used a pacifier (Avent, silicone, flatter nipple, 10 years ago) and after 18 months of chasing binkies in the middle of the night, I swore them off. Our middle four children sucked their thumbs to varying degrees and now our 6th has a fierce suck reflex, but he is too little and uncoordinated to reach his thumbs when he wants them. After receiving an orange newborn GumDrop from the hospital (out of desperation for a few moment's peace), I purchased a double pack newborn and a double pack 3+ months from Amazon. After the first week I noticed the newborn paci consistently popped out of our son's mouth when he would relax. I could never hold him one handed while doing chores. My other hand had to be pressed against the paci to keep it in place. Also, during suction he would have to suck really hard, making loud sucking noises - as if he could never get enough nipple in his mouth. This caused him to swallow a lot of air, which meant he had to be lifted from a reclined, dozy position to be burped. Also, his lips always tucked inward, not outward like they do on the breast. Putting him down for a nap was impossible because he would either 1). startle himself awake with the sucking noise/air swallowing/gas or 2). the paci would pop out after two sucks and he wasn't tired enough to overcome the reflex.<br /><br />Thinking the newborn size nipple might be too small I ordered the 3+ month size and noticed hardly any difference. The silicone is slightly more rigid in the 3+ month paci, but there is no difference in nipple length or width (see pictures).<br /><br />After thinking about it some more, it occurred to me that the GumDrop nipple doesn't mimic the human nipple in any way, what-so-ever. My 6th child is getting a far larger human nipple than my first - comes with the territory! My newborn needs a larger nipple to be satisfied. He also needs one that conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding. The GumDrop nipple unfortunately retains its original rigid shape when the baby relaxes. My nipple remains flat (stuck in the suction of the baby) when my son relaxes. Tonight (5 weeks later!) I finally broke down and bought a Nuk, since it appears to mimic a veteran mommy nipple: longer, flatter nipple that retains flatness and doesn't pop out of Baby's mouth. Hasn't fallen out all day. Baby is sleeping soundly now.<br /><br />I would also agree with other commentors that it is unclear if First Years is the same as Hawaii Medical. My hospital paci has a 1-800 number stamped into it, not &#34;First Years&#34; like the Hawaii Medical GumDrops I received from Amazon. As you'll see in the photos, the hospital paci has a &#34;matte&#34; finish (which probably feels rougher, more like a human nipple) and the First Years is shiny and smooth.<br /><br />*photo (left to right) orange newborn GumDrop, green 3+ months First Years GumDrop, blue Nukthat conforms similarly to a human nipple, which flattens considerably during breastfeeding.

She is 3 months and she is able to grab onto the stuffed kitten and put the paci back in her mouth - a task she hasn't quite mastered yet with her traditional pacifiers. She was also able to grab onto the stuffed part from a pretty early age. When she was a newborn, I was able to swaddle in her Wubba so that she didn't &#34;lose it.&#34;<br /><br />The pacifier part of the Wubba is an Avent Soothie, which is approved for use with babies under 6 months. I love that the WubbaNub collection uses a well known and respected pacifier manufacturer, since that is the part that goes in my child's mouth. The stuffed animal part is similar to a beanie baby. It is very soft, not too big, and not too heavy - perfect for an infant to handle.<br /><br />It is also important to note that the Wubba's wash nicely. We have the Tabby Kitten, Giraffe, and Red Dog and all of them have been in the wash several times by now. They come out nice and clean and looking like new. I am sure that as my child grows and is more mobile that they will see heavier use and show some signs of aging, but so far I am very please with the quality on this item and it is used daily.<br /><br />My daughter loves them so much that I know I will not only be buying more of them for her, but I will also be giving these to my expecting friends.",12/5/2014

50854110,RA22T5S7CIFRG,380619977,5,0,0,N,My 5 year old still sleeps with hers!,"Let me start by saying the nipple part of the pacifier is long-gone.  She bit holes it years ago, as her teeth were coming in.  I snipped off the rest down to the base, and that was the end of pacifiers for her.  But it wasn't the end of the kitty...<br /><br />In the beginning, WubbaNub pacifiers were a LIFE-SAVER for us!  Our younger daughter was born with a horrific case of reflux.  It was strongly suggested by many professionals that she use a pacifier to help keep the acid from bothering her too much.  But what a pain it was to keep popping it back in ever few minutes, especially during the night (not that she was sleeping all that much--again, due to the reflux).  Duct tape was jokingly considered.<br /><br />An internet search eventually lead me to the WubbaNub website, and I found a local dealer to buy from (they weren't on Amazon back then).  She was 3 months old when she got her first kitty, and a back-up kitty followed several months later.  The rest is history.<br /><br />When she was a baby, it worked fantastically!  It wasn't too long before she learned to push the pacifier back into her own mouth and save me the trouble.  It was a little lighter weight than I had expected, but it still worked wonderfully.<br /><br />When we bought it, we had NO idea that we were getting her a friend for life.  And what a life it's had!  As of today, the nipple is gone (only a green ring remains), the rear left leg has no more stuffing in it and is pretty thoroughly mangled (she likes to rub it between her fingers as she falls asleep), the coloring has faded a bit, and I just noticed that the stitching along the spine is starting to show slightly.  But after all these years, and all the LOVE it's received, I'm not surprised by the wear-and-tear.  Honestly, I'm a little shocked it's held up so well.<br /><br />To say this is her favorite lovie/toy would be putting it lightly.  Some day, she may choose to put it on the shelf and be done with it, but that day isn't any time soon.  :)",1/10/2013

I think that the shape and feel of the plastic is too different from what he prefers most: the breast. He seems to have trouble forming suction in the way that you do while breast feeding. Like most traditional pacifiers, there is a ninety degree angle/ perpendicular junction between the hard plastic outside shell and inner soft plastic piece that goes in the mouth. This composition makes it difficult for him to latch on as it is so different from how one latches onto the breast. Anyway, I suspect that if your baby generally likes pacifiers, they will probably like these. But if they are choosy and/or exclusively breast fed, they may not like these. therefore, you may want to think twice if you're purchasing or registering for these for a baby that hasn't arrived yet, or until you have a better sense of their preferences.",10/4/2011

I tried 2 others and she wouldn't have them at all. I tried to go without one at all but that wasn't an option with her. She has a very strong urge to suck to soothe. Since she's breastfed too, that meant that I was nursing her for 2/3+ of the day. As soon as I went back to the soothie pacifer she loved it but could not hold on to it for anything so we pretty much had to hold it for her the whole time. Then, I decided to try a wubbanub. Best decision ever!<br />I actually got this giraffe one from a yardsale right after I had ordered my daughter the pink 'mary meyer jasmine giraffe'. I thought I'd like it better because it was all pink and cute but wanted to have a 2nd as a backup/ rotation. But, once I got the pink one in I really did not like it. It's not as floppy or long as this giraffe, which makes all the difference. And it looks nothing like a giraffe- short neck- more like a horse or cow? lol.<br />This one is perfect for laying on my daughters chest or beside her and it holds the pacifier for her perfectly.<br />She's 2,5 mos old and just getting to the point of trying to grab it and put it back in her mouth herself. She's getting pretty good at it, considering she really don't have much hand eye coordination. She can shove the giraffe's head around with her hands and root around until she gets it back in her mouth. The other one just falls away if she quits sucking.<br />I wanted 2 to have to rotate through and to have a backup.

I saw the negative reviews and had concerns but all the positive reviews swayed me and I took a leap of faith to purchase.<br /><br />Well it arrived in super-fast time thanks to Amazon Prime, however the Giraffe and pacifier are so poor quality I’m returning immediately.<br /><br />The packaging arrived intact, though it looked a cheaply printed, I’ve never seen these in stores but would love to compare packaging to check if this is authentic. The pacifier part is a joke. It’s tiny and not the standard AVENT soothie given to you at the hospital or that you can buy in stores. My main concern was that without opening the packaging, I could see that the giraffe body had holes in it and the stuffing was coming out. The stitching along the spine of the giraffe was very shoddy and loose and would fall apart within days, if not sooner.<br /><br />This item is potentially a serious choking hazard and SHOULD NOT be sold for babies or children.

My baby didn't like it much at first, either. Then, we re-introduced it around 5 months and he LOVED it and stopped using any of his other pacifiers. I think maybe the fact that he was more mobile- able to roll over and almost crawling and so it was easier for him to find it in the crib. I truly believe that this item was what got him to start sleeping through the night because SO many of the night wakes were just that he lost his pacifier.<br /><br />What a previous reviewer had complained about (how the whole thing has to go in the wash) I think is one of the best features. When it's dirty, you just throw the whole thing in the wash and it dries (I just hang it up rather than put in the dryer) within a couple hours.<br /><br />I do suggest having three in rotation. Our daycare already lost one. If we didn't have a back-up, it could have been bad. Oh- and don't pay more than $15. Occasionally, these items (the different animals) will be out of stock and other sellers through Amazon will have some for sale for $30+. Don't worry about it because a) they get back into stock pretty quickly and b) if a baby will take one, chances are he/she'll take whichever other one (duck, giraffe, bull, etc.) We've switched out regularly and there's never been a preference.",12/1/2012

WubbaNub (or Wubs, as he's called at our house) is a great friend and comfort for our baby. Why? Major pros:<br /><br />* Easy to grip: The feet are just big enough and round enough that she can get a solid grasp on any of them, and sometimes two at a time.<br />* Easy to hold: The little, soft body, which is filled with something slightly softer than beans, is easy for the baby to wrap an arm around, and light enough that she can lift and spin the giraffe with one determined fist.<br />* Easy for chewing: Not only are the feet satisfying for snacking, the little horns at the face make for interesting small chewy pieces against hier gums.<br />* High quality silicone pacifier: The Soothie pacifier that's attached is great, not just for the usual Soothie benefits but also because it's very sturdily attached to the giraffe's body. It can safely travel the washer and then be rinsed in hot water itself for maximum cleanliness.<br /><br />Points for debate:<br />* Doesn't always stay in her mouth longer. Yep, true -- sometimes she tugs it out. But she also seems less likely to have the whole thing drop from her grasp and fall to the floor; Wubs hits the deck much less often than the other, solo Soothies we have around the house.<br />* Longevity: We've had this in heavy rotation (daily play time probably equal to two hours) for a month, and he's showing a bit of wear.

Furthermore, it was too small and he had a hard time sucking/keeping it in. AUGH how frustrating.  Someone said;OH noooo he needs to have his sucking needs met.

With the stuffed animal attached, it give it enough weight that that no longer happens (or happens less frequently).

I have to say my son loves it, he's 5 and a half weeks old and has been using it since day 3.  Luckily it didn't cause and nipple confusion for him.  It did start helping him sleep really well through the night.  He loves holding onto the little giraffe and it's really cute watching him.  Washing it is the only issue, what I have done so far is stick the nipple part in the boiling water while I'm sterilizing other baby things but I have read recently on a forum that they can be put in the washer safely and then you air dry it, I will have to try that soon.",3/4/2011

10132920,RFJUM3R6FUKH5,392768822,5,0,1,N,TOTAL lifesaver and SUPER cute!!!,"Our little guy, now 7 months, LOVES his wubbies. He has 3: the giraffe, the monkey, and the puppy, but this is his favorite. We put them in his crib at night and if he wakes up crying, he finds one, puts it in his mouth, and goes back to sleep about 90% of the time completely on his own. He's been able to put them in his own mouth for a couple months now. In the morning, he wakes up and collects all three together and plays with them for about an hour which lets us sleep in, another huge plus :). If he's tired or fussy, his wubs soothe him right away. Because of the little animal attached, he doesn't lose or drop it very easily at all, and it gives him something to hold on to which is very comforting for him. He also loves it for teething now. I am very confident that learning to pick these up on his own and put them in his mouth has really increased his manual dexterity. They wash really easily in the washing machine and you don't even have to stick them in the dryer because they dry so fast. The only downside is if you have pets the hair may stick to the pacifier part, but we don't have this problem. Did I mention we get TONS of compliments on how cute they are? You really can't go wrong with these little guys!!! They are probably my favorite of all our baby items :).",12/4/2010

I'll definitely be tossing that bad boy in the wash ASAP!!!! :). Great product! Well made! My son wasn't crazy about pacis in general in the beginning, but we just kept this one around (as well as a soothie without the elephant attached) and he's come around (especially now that he's teething!)<br /><br />As for the &#34;I could make this myself&#34;ers... You absolutely could. But by the time you buy the $3 soothie, the $4 plush stuffed animal and figure out whether you should hot glue or sew it... I say just splurge a little.

13181561,R2QFA1CFQICIBW,450475749,3,1,4,N,Not for MY 0-3 Month old,"UPDATE##### I am changing my review to Neutral (3/5) because I now realize that my  (now) 6 month old does not like pacifiers. He may have never liked pacifiers and he may never will. My 3 year old will not ween off his pacifier but my youngest does not do them.  Your child may not like this product, and judging by the other reviews, it may not be the Plush Toy Pacifier, it just might be your kid.<br /><br />Let me just say that this is the worse pacifier ever. If I could use profanity to describe this frustrating little plush toy pacifier, this review would be nothing but four letter words mixed with a couple conjunctions  and verbs and tons of profane adjectives, but since we are all parents or know someone who is, I will keep it clean.<br /><br />This pacifier does not stay in the infants mouth, the plush toy is actually a hinderance to keeping it in an infants mouth, and because of this, this pacifier is useless. The actual rubber part is very anatomically close to an actual human nipple, so to the infant, no other pacifier will do. So now you are ...lets just say you are in a very difficult position because you are forced to hold the pacifier in place , so whats the use. Our infant son is 5 weeks old and extremely fussy during his bewitching hour, a pacifier that stays in place would be so useful at this time, but instead, we are force to deal with a very unhappy child between 7 and 11pm. Maybe this is a great product when the infant is older, but by 3 months, a baby can manipulate is own pacifier, so again this product is useless.<br /><br />If you are a parent to be, please do not put this on your registry. If you are a friend or family of a new parent please do not give this as a gift. If you are the creator of this product , I hope karma comes back and makes you pay for what you have done to parents of newborns.",1/26/2013

Basically when baby's face is on the side while lying in bed you just put the monkey lying close to him (not parallel) putting the paci in baby's mouth, The paci stayed in his mouth and even if it came out my baby was able to pull it back in most of the times.

It was perfect timing since we were headed out of the house.

I absolutely love the &#34;handle&#34; that hangs down from the front so that the binkie can be easy to grab, hold, carry - without having to touch the whole thing (for those germaphobes like muah).<br /><br />The plastic is almost a clearish color, which makes the entertainment factor of these binkies awesome since most of what you see is just the 'stach.  Be prepared to have your camera out the first time you use them.  Your kids will wonder why you are laughing and giggling like a child, and they will be stone cold serious as they suck away wondering what is so funny.  Pictures to last a lifetime.<br /><br />I coincidentally purchased stickers for my youngest that says &#34;If you Mustache, I am X months old&#34;.

The pacifier was fantastic obviously but what I really loved about the wubbanub frog was that even after he weaned himself at five months he still liked to carry around and cuddle the frog. When I worked in pediatrics we were given a bunch for free in an attempt to get the hospital to sign on to purchasing them, sadly they did not but during that time I was sold. They're easy to find if dropped or in the bottom of an overpacked diaper bag and they balance on top of swaddled babies. But really the reason I love them now are the dozens of photos I have of my baby boy cuddling his little frog.

Washing was a breeze - I just stuck it in the washing machine with his clothes and would let it air dry.<br /><br />Another bonus, around 1 year of age, HE decided to stop using it on his own.  I'm so glad that I didn't have to go through that battle with him!  I think that kids generally don't want large items hanging out of their mouth by that age...so rather than have the trouble of getting rid of a pacifier at 2+, he has learned to self soothe without one.<br /><br />Thanks WubbaNub for making a quality product that we all enjoy!

Usually, we would run the binkies through the sanitizer, but this left the stuffed animal part soggy. Now the child is over three years old and still uses these binkies.

I thought it would help him learn to put it back in as well as be weighty enough to lay on his chest in just the right spot - so if he fell asleep he could pop it back in himself. And - believe it or not - it did all those things. HOWEVER - my son totally hated the pacifier. We had been using every brand of binkies, so I figured what's another new brand? Right? WRONG! We had used nuks, playtex, avent, etc. All with no problem but the soothie pacifier attached to this wubbanub is HUGE. I am not kidding. Not just huge on the outside plastered on your little one's face...but huge like a giant long nipple too! Coupled with the fact it was ugly as sin it made for hilarity at starbucks one day when all the other mommies watched in horror as I proudly pulled out my new fancy wubba to give to my little one and he proceeded to choke like a bulimic after thanksgiving. AND, the poor little dude kept giving it the old college try because he wanted the sucker and I let him because I forgot back up. I just kept praying he'd make it work. It was all very sad. Long story much shorter I sent my hubby to babies r' us to pick up as many small stuffed animals as he could find. That weekend I bought velcro and we created our own wubanubs. Here are 3 major benifits to making your own:<br />1) you can detach the pacifier and wash it for REAL. As well as wash the buddy it is attached too! Unlike the wubba. IMPORTANT - The wubbanub DOES NOT come apart ( very gross and stupid)<br />2) you can use whatever brand of pacifier your little one enjoys, a major plus if you actually want this whole learn your paci is attached to a frog thing to work.<br />and<br />3) Compared to the ugly things my little macgyvered knock offs look amazing.

25021259,R2TQJQQI29CPMG,51313971,4,4,4,N,No complaints here...,"The Munchkin Healthflow Deluxe Bottle and Food Warmer is easy and convenient. Using the water measure is not an exact science and has been more of a trial and error process. I say error meaning that slightly too little water (lower measurement mark) just means the 2-3 oz of chilled formula warmed in a Ventaire 6 oz bottle is only luke warm...which doesn't seem to phase my infant when she is ready for a meal. Also, if the water measurement is filled over the upper mark, the bottle is still comfortably warm for feeding. My husband and I have not had a bottle that was too cold or too hot which is one less thing to worry and fuss about when we are half asleep fumbling in the kitchen in the middle of the night to feed our newborn.<br /><br />Because of the type of bottles we use, we occasionally have formula leak out from the bottom seal during the warming process. This is easy to clean even if it gets baked a bit from the warming plate by using the bottle scrubber, dish soap, and a paper towel to wipe it up. The leak can be avoided, by the way, if you take the cap off before heating so that the pressure escapes through the top (nipple) rather than the bottom (seal) of the Ventaire bottle.<br /><br />I do not know how the warmer will perform when the baby starts to drink more each feeding. If we continue to use ready-to-feed formula which needs to be chilled I imagine we might have to warm larger bottles twice before they are ready. More likely, we will switch to powdered formula and flouridated water at room temperature which will only need one time through the warmer.<br /><br />In summary: Four stars for a good product only because I anticipate having to be flexible with it's use.",2/20/2006

I picked this up when my girl was about 3 mo on a whim having previously refused to spend so much on a binkie for my son when he was little or my new baby. Wow was I irritated with myself for not giving these a go 3 years ago. My daughter was 5 weeks premature and about 5 pounds, so small but not excessively so and the first 3 months we struggled to find her a binkie that would work as she had the tiniest mouth (so tiny that even the binkies for real preemies didn't fit her tiny mouth, tiny mouths are genetic in our family to begin with) so we tried everything available and as soon as we popped a binkie bear in her mouth and she snuggled the bear into her tiny arms I knew we had found magic. Due to some really serious heath complications from my pregnancy that had me bedridden and in and out of the hospital for the first 9 months of her life, it was imperative we find something she could sooth herself with and this product was a godsend. I'm not sure if they work for children under 3 mo who can't even partially grasp at objects but by that time she was able to sort of grab the plush part enough to cuddle it and this kept the pacifier portion in her mouth most of the time, plus it's so large that it's very difficult to lose tho not impossible I promise. The only downside is that the plush portion isn't machine washable, you can hand soak and disinfect but considering they spend so much time in babies mouth they get pretty nasty looking and matted and stiff after a few months even if their technically &#34;clean&#34;. However I can't imagine a reasonable design workaround that would allow the binkie to be attached but still washable so I can't hold that against the manufacturer. I'm a little disappointed that our local slave labor big box store stopped carrying them because they were only costing me about $6.99 and every place else charges at least twice thatplus shipping. It's still worth it to keep my daughter happy because she's miserable without one of these babies close by. She pretty much snubs her nose at any pacifier without an attached teddy bear now which put us in a real pickle last weekend when she lost ALL three during one infamous Ikea trip where she's was in a particularly gravity obsessed mood in the linens and no one seems to sell them brick and mortar since I last stocked up. I'm telling you, short of duct tape and a visit by child protective services, these pacifiers will a happy baby make and a happy baby is a happy mama (much like my happiness dictates my husband's sleeping arrangements).

When they are riding in the carseat, you can use the plush body to keep the pacifier in the child's mouth. These DO get filthy though... they fall on the floor and the plush part gets dirty. We usually throw them in the wash with a non scented mild baby detergent, let them air dry, and then clean the rubber part with a mild dish soap. Also, the rubber part is NOT removable. If the child bites through the rubber, the pacifier part can not be replaced.",10/31/2013

But then my lactation consultant noted that the Gumdrop/Soothie nipple is definitely fine for breastfed babies, and so I decided to try to use them in place of me when they needed to go to sleep, especially during the day. My babies were sucking just for comfort ALL THE TIME, and while some of that is good (and good for your milk supply), most women probably can't spend all day serving as a human pacifier.

23386254,R2UTZPKJ6ZYF1X,610554685,1,6,9,N,NOT the same as ORIGINAL GumDrop,"Tried several different pacifiers and our daughter would only take the original one given to her at the hospital.  We got tired of washing the same pacifier over and over again so when we saw First Years made the GumDrop pacifier, we were very excited.  Unfortunately, this is NOT the same pacifier - it is squeakier (more plasticky than the original rubbery one) and less flexible.  In conclusion, just buy the Hawaii Medical Group one because this one is just a waste of money.  I am giving it only 1 star because I feel I was misled by the name which makes me mad.  If First Years insists on making a copy of the original, they need to give it a copy-like name (for example RainDrop or GumBall - I don't know, just a thought).",8/11/2011

These are hard, shiny silicone whereas the originals are softer and matte, which many breastfed babies prefer since it is less plasticky.  The shield is quite hard against my son's face, compared to the original.  Because of this he just teethes on this and chews all over it, and its useless as a pacifier.     I'm sure these are fine pacifiers, but I wish they had a more obviously different name than Gumdrops(by The First Years instead of Hawaii Medical).",6/20/2011

He became attached to it very quickly and wouldn't take any other pacifier when we were suppose to transition him off of it. But I thought no big deal what could it hurt. Well he is now 5months old and he did what they he could do. I had read of babies being able to stick the whole thing in their mouth n I too was a little skeptic about it but today he accomplished it! N thank goodness I was holding him when he did it because I had been putting him to bed with it and it could of been a lot worse. So yes some moms say that they have older babies taking it with no problems which might be the case BUT don't take the risk! Because when your baby starts teething like mine they want everything in their mouth and they get aggressive with it and believe it or not but they can fit it in their mouth!

Guess she never really caught onto the whole sucking thing) and would not accept any type of pacifier(like many parents we bought every pacifier on the market). That was until a friend told us they had a similar dilema and bought us a pack to try out. She absolutely loves them! They are perfect hold overs for until she really wants to eat.    These pacifiers are one piece and without the plastic guard. The advantage to this is that it reduces the chances of nasties lurking in the seams/cracks of where the plastic joins the nipple from improper washing or not sterilizing. Unless you are disassembling your childs two piece pacifier(plastic from nipple) and cleaning it, you're not cleaning it as well as your tell yourself.    Some  perhaps your child shouldn't be using them. These are NEWBORN PACIFIERS as stated on the package. If your child is not a NEWBORN then it's probably best to move onto other pacifiers more appropriately sized for your child. Everyone is different but I have a hard time believing a NEWBORN(as these are made for NEWBORNS) can swallow the entire pacifier. I've tried and had trouble myself.    Other complaints about the lack of 'bulbing' at the tip of the pacifier which makes it difficult for the newborn to hold in it's mouth is nothing more than laziness. Pay your child more attention. If your child is sucking her thumb(or mittens, sleeves, blankie, what have you) then she/he is  either hungry or wants comfort. If you're sticking a pacifier in a NEWBORNs mouth just so you don't have to listen to them cry, it's probably a good time to rethink your methods of raising a child. A pacifier is a great way to comfort or help increase her appetite(we used these to increase her appetite and get her in the habit of sucking so she would eat more) but should not be used simply as adistraction so you don't have to deal with them.     Lastly, people say these are ugly as sin. I agree, but your child doesn't care:) Just like all the decorations or excessive amount of money you can spend on newborn clothing, your child does not care.    If it works, it work. Every child is different. For our kid that had trouble grasping the 'sucking' motions for the first few months(whether it was breastfeeding or the Playtex slow flow latex wide nipples which are the absolute slowest nipples around!), these helped her become strong and healthy!",3/21/2010

My son took it and it certainly helped in those early days where he wanted to suck 24-7.  He never could keep it in his mouth though which I chalked up to being so little and perhaps not convinced that he loved the pacifier.  I wasn't convinced I wanted him to love it so that was OK.     Then at 1 month he would scream whenever we gave it to him so we quit.  At 3 months though he started sucking on everything and we broke out the pacifier again.  He could hold it in his mouth for a little while but without careful attention it gets pushed out.  Now at 3.5 months we need a pacifier so that my husband might have a chance of putting the baby to bed when I'm not here to nurse him down.  The soothie falls out so fast that there is no chance it could work to do anything but comfort him when he is really upset.      With some experimentation we have discovered that he needs   a) the shield that is molded to the face.  The soothie shield (and the natursutten [[ASIN:B001AVNK6E Natursutten All-Natural Rubber Orthodontic Pacifier, 0-6 months]] that we tried) bumps up against his nose and gravity makes it more likely to fall out.    b) a more shaped nipple.  The orthodontic ones work but so does the MAM [[ASIN:B00211NRF6 Sassy Mam Mini Trends Silicone Pacifier - Size 1 - 0-6 months - boy colors]] nipple (which is shaped like a bulb but theoretically compresses to an orthodontic shape, though it doesn't really when I tried it. )  The bulb shape of the MAM seems to be enough to keep it behind his gums which seems to help it stay in too.    We just tried out the MAM and he kept it in his mouth for 30 minutes before pushing it out with his tongue (while playing)!  It also has no top/bottom like the soothie so it is easier to get in his mouth in the dark.    Pacifiers are cheap (except for the Natursutten) so it isn't a big deal to try a few different ones--just because one baby does well with one doesn't mean another one will or won't.  But for us, the MAM worked much better.  I'm wondering if we should have tried it earlier--perhaps it would have been helpful in those fussy early months where he wouldn't take the soothie.",8/10/2009

I was paranoid that since I was breastfeeding, that any pacifier was going to ruin things... but we were at the hospital for a test and the baby was fussing a bit and the nurse asked if we had a pacifier and I said no. She reached into the cupboard and pulled out one of these, saying they were highly recommended. We took it from her, thanked her, and threw it in the diaper bag. (We didn't try it right then because, as I mentioned, I did NOT want my baby to use a pacifier.)<br /><br />And then came a time when he was really fussy. And we had just watched The Happiest Baby on the Block DVD and learned that Sucking is something that, ironically, PACIFIES a baby and calms them down... so I gave the baby the Soothie...and he loved it! LOVED IT! I immediately went out and bought two more 2-packs (from Target and Babies R Us). I also bought the next-stage pacifiers (one step up from newborn).<br /><br />Of course if he is super agitated (or hungry) then it won't stay in his mouth, but if he is somewhat calm already, then it's enough to keep him calm. I never thought the pacifier was too heavy, as another reviewer thought, claiming that was why it wouldn't stay in the baby's mouth. I also never thought the pacifier holder was too big. I didn't have any pacifier attachers yet, so I just bought the ones made for this pacifier and it worked just fine.<br /><br />As far as the breastfeeding worries, I continued breastfeeding for a few weeks after the introduction of the Soothie with no ill effect.",4/14/2009

The item itself seems terribly flimsy, and just has a cheap feel, much cheaper than I would expect from a product that's more expensive than a lot of competing products. Maybe it's composed of a tough, lightweight plastic, but if something looks cheap and feels cheap, well, let's just say it doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in a product.<br /><br />The next concern is battery life, which is rather poor. I guess those UV rays must take a lot of juice, because a fresh set of batteries doesn't last very long. That leads in to wondering just how well this thing works, especially when the batteries start to die down a bit. It takes about 3 minutes to sterilize a pacifier, but there's no real way to know how well it's working. Also, the directions tell you to rinse off the pacifier prior to use, so that might limit just how useful it is when you're on-the-go. Ultimately, I just wonder if using this is really any better than rinsing off the pacifier under very hot tap water.<br /><br />I wanted to like the Pipila Portable Pacifier Sterilizer, but at the end of the day, it just leaves me wondering if it's doing the job. I can see it having a place for people going out-of-town for a bit and wanting something available to help sterilize a pacifier if they're staying away from home, but the need for water (to rinse the pacifier) and the size (small, but not that small) limits its usefulness for those truly on-the-go, while there are better, cheaper ways to get the job done when you're at home.",8/21/2012

Now, I've not done any scientific tests, but this thing is very cheap looking/feeling plastic, takes a few AAA batteries and when you press it down (sometimes) a very ordinary light comes on and then switches off after awhile. Again, it may work, but if I had to bet whether it did or didn't, I would whole heartedly bet on that it didn't. The manufacturers might do well to either make the light brighter or make the thing hum or vibrate so it looks like it is doing something, but no - a normal light comes on and then it goes off and miraculously the pacifier that just fell on the floor is supposed to be sterile? I don't know.<br /><br />I do know that if it has snot on it or small pieces of dust or dirt, they don't fall off. They don't look different after going into this gadget, so I would save myself the money and buy some wipes that will at least get the junk off of a pacifier that falls on the ground or your kid has been sucking on forever, because at least it cleans it off.

It's a great idea. In just moments the pacifier is sterilized and ready to go back to baby. However, for $35 I expect something a little more sturdy that this gizmo. I am on the fence as whether or not to recommend this product to anyone because of this; hence the three stars.

My 2 month girl and I refer to it as her &#34;Lamby&#34;. We've been using the Wub since she was 3 weeks since she spits out all other pacis.<br /><br />As all Wubs go, great clever design. Helps keep the paci in place because the plush toy gives it some weight but not too much. If the baby wants to spit it out, she still can. And once baby is old enough they can hold it and snuggle it while they use the paci part...or not. They are so soft.<br /><br />I'm also hoping that because there is an attached plush, it'll be easier to wean her off pacis when it's time.<br /><br />I wished the paci part was removable for washing and changing. I throw the entire Wub a lingerie bag and wash with a load of baby laundry. But I'm not sure how great that is since some of the baby laundry is quite soiled. So after I hang dry, I wash the paci again in the kitchen sink with hot soapy water before use. Also my girl is starting to prefer the more bulbous orthodontic pacis instead of the newborn Avent Soothie used on the Wubs. She might grow out of the &#34;Lamby&#34; if she no longer likes the shape and texture of the attached paci.

I believe it's the softness and shape of the paci that makes it feel like the breast. My baby cries for the paci as soon as he feels full from the breast, that's how much he loves sucking it. It's also a great chew toy for him, when he's not soothing, he likes to take out the paci and chew all around it, the round flap, the ring at the back. Guess the bouncy rubber is so fun to chew on. I wish they would make actual chew toy out of the same material!  I bought two 5 months ago so that I can have a spare, and baby has been using them this whole time. The paci did turn brown, and gets sticky as soon as it dries up, but rinse it in a little water when it sticks and its good to suck on again. That's why I would recommend anyone to buy a couple at least to switch around if one gets dirty/sticky. But there's really no need to replace them just because of this.

I noticed a lot of reviewers mentioned how you have to replace it so often, which worried me at first, too, b/c of the price. But on the manufacturer's website, they say that while they have to have that recommendation on their packaging due to European standards, you don't actually have to replace it nearly that often.

We started my baby on the soothie but he never could keep it in his mouth.  After experimenting with a cheap-o luvs orthodontic pacifier I decided the orthodontic shape would work much better.      First off, the rubber discolored when I sterilized it.  I don't know if that makes a difference, but it came out with a white tinge to it.  He took it right away and the shaped nipple helped keep it in but because the shield hits his nose, it still falls out easily.  The shields that are shaped to the face seem to help him keep it in more easily.  Another flaw is that the loop sticks out from his face, and since my son grabs at everything he can, he keeps pulling it out of his mouth.      Maybe if he wasn't in such a grabby stage or was more able to keep it in his mouth I would have liked it better.
